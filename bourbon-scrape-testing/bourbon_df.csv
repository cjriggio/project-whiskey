0, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,96.6,12 Years, $50 (2019),"Traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel are plentiful, with toffee and honey providing an additional layer of sweetness. Oak is also present, but gentle in its assertiveness. Overall mild in complexity and intensity, the nose is quite enjoyable, but plays it safe.","Walnut, toasted oak, and rye spice produce a bold front to the flavor profile. Much of the sweetness the nose hinted at has disappeared on the palate. Almost immediately you can feel the dryness of the bourbon hit your tongue. Without much sweetness to help balance this, the bourbon is a bit one-sided and certainly doesnât hide its age.","Quite dry, with ample amounts of oak and bitter tannins throughout the medium length finish. Mild caramel and nutty notes come forth, but are devoid of any sweetness. It has some heat that ramps up in the finish, further amplifying its oakiness which leaves a rather dry aftertaste.","Once upon a time, 1792 Small Batch featured an 8 year age statement and we were big fans of this iteration. It offered a good balance of age and youth compounded by bold flavors and ample oak. We were sad to see it go in 2013, as the new no age statement 1792 Small Batch is much more straightforward, and as a result less interesting despite being very drinkable. Since then, Barton has released a slew of unique variations of 1792, with Sweet Wheat and Port Finish rating highest. Weâre continuously impressed by 1792 single barrel selections, some of which completely took us by surprise with their flavor profiles and extreme drinkability. Age statements have been slowly returning (Heaven Hill Bottled-in-Bond 7 Year, Knob Creek Small Batch 9 Year), and others remain steadfast (Henry McKenna 10 Year, Eagle Rare 10 Year), yet outside of limited releases they are, for the most part, few and far between. For Bartonâs latest 1792 release, the bourbon itself may not be overly unique, but itâs the bourbonâs 12 year age statement that will draw attention. What was once common is now unique. How unique will depend on how long youâve been around bourbon, but at this moment in time, itâs uncommon to see a 12 year age statement.","It was to be expected that after removing age statements, distilleries would return them one day, except pricing these ânewâ products at higher point. Barton could have easily returned 1792 Small Batchâs original age statement of 8 years and charged $50. This probably would have been met with some contention as a single digit age statement just doesnât seem that impressive anymore, despite a world with few age statements. Yet, $50 for a 12 year old bourbon is quite acceptable in todayâs marketplace and maintains 1792âs value pricing that theyâve long been known for. For its 2019 batch, the additional aging time didnât do much to improve the base product, and in more than a few ways, probably harmed it. In fact, the product reminds me of what a lot of age stated bourbons used to taste like earlier this decade: Oaky, serviceable, and more times than not, just average. On paper, $50 in todayâs marketplace is a great value for a 12 year old bourbon. I just wish this 12 year old 1792 bourbon was a little bit better to make it an even greater value.",,1792 Aged Twelve Years (1792 12 Year)
1, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,100,NAS, $36 (2018),"Rye spice, vanilla, and caramel are most prominent with a trace of oak underneath. The scents are oddly a bit light, lacking the anticipated dose of ethanol I would expect for 100 proof. Enjoyable overall.","Rye spice mingles with caramel and vanilla creating a flavor profile thatâs easily alluded to based on the aroma. Thereâs a developed amount of seasoned oak as well, giving it much needed dimension. The rye spice and seasoned oak present themselves most prominently, overtaking the sweeter notes, which ultimately makes for a characteristically spicy sip. Itâs not quite as chewy as compared to 1792 Small Batch, but it does have a nice mouthfeel overall.","The sip ends nicely with rye spice and seasoned oak dominating the start of the finish. Thereâs a hint of caramel sweetness as well, providing a sweeter note to contrast the more overpowering spice found in the finish. Medium to long lasting.","To draw a comparison to 1792 Bottled in Bond, you donât need to look very far. In fact, Barton makes two very similar products - 1792 Small Batch and Very Old Barton Bottled In Bond.1792 Small Batch is Bartonâs flagship product, released year round and easily accessible. Presumably the same mashbill, the only difference we can identify with certainty is the proof - 100 for Bottled In Bond versus Small Batchâs fairly close 93.7. Both labels require a minimum age of 4 years, and while the Bottled In Bond must be the product of one distillation season we canât say with certainty Small Batch isnât. With that in mind, however, it wouldnât be unreasonable to believe barrels of varying ages (and as a result distillation seasons) are mingled together to create Small Batch. It also wouldnât be unreasonable to assume Bottled In Bond is more carefully curated as barrels from a single distillation season are more carefully selected prior to batching. But then again, these are just assumptions.What might be an even closer product, or maybe even the same, is Bartonâs own Very Old Barton Bottled In Bond. It once came with a 6 year age statement but that has been removed in favor of a no age statement (NAS) version. My best guess is that this is most likely released in the 4-5 year old range, however we donât know for sure. Bargain priced and bottled in less âpremiumâ looking packaging than 1792 Bottled In Bond, itâs possible the two products are identical in every way except for their labels. To compare, I lined up all three and tasted them. Iâll note that each had been open for some time with a fair amount of air space in the bottle (including the 1792 Bottled In Bond), though the 1792 Bottled In Bond was in a small media sample bottle. The Very Old Barton was the most potent and also most rough around the edges, but with that it also demonstrated the most character. Due to its lower proof 1792 Small Batch was the least potent, but not by much. What it allowed for was more of the flavors to pull through, and for whatever reason had the best mouthfeel of the three. 1792 Bottled in Bond kind of split the difference. It offered more potency and spice than 1792 Small Batch, but wasnât quite as potent and rough around the edges as Very Old Barton. Most notably, the three were only marginally different, and I think all things considered it would come down to merely personal preference in deciding which was the favorite.","At more than double the price of Very Old Barton Bottled In Bond and a 45% premium over 1792 Small Batch, you could easily argue 1792 Bottled In Bond is a terrible value. In many ways I would agree with that. However, outside of that comparison I canât ignore the fact that Barton is introducing a new Bottled in Bond bourbon to the market and charging $36 for it - not necessarily a steal but really not a deal breaking price tag as far as Iâm concerned. Considering the fact that Barton only plans to release it once a year in the fall, I would assume it will serve to showcase particular batches, by distillation season of course, that they feel offer something a bit more special than their standard Small Batch release. Since itâs more well rounded than Very Old Barton Bottled In Bond by my comparison, I would also assume they intend it to be a more refined product. To that end, while it isnât a must have bourbon at a must have price, it is reasonably priced overall.","One batch will be released each fall, beginning in 2017",1792 Bottled in Bond
2, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,125,NAS (Press Release states 8.5 years), $45 (2016),"The alcohol is immediately noticeable and jumps right out of the glass. Hiding behind the alcohol are dry oak, caramel, and a dab of vanilla. While these classic bourbon scents are appreciated, theyâre quickly forgotten, and combined with the ever present alcohol, it leaves a lot to be desired.","Sweeter than the nose would lead you to believe. Sweet corn, cinnamon, syrup-soaked raisins, dried cherries, and a dash of vanilla are all present. While it contains a lot of heat, the palate is still very pleasant and the star of the show, offering a really nice mouthfeel and is easy to appreciate at its full proof (no pun intended).","The heat ramps up big time and is immediately noticeable the moment the finish starts. The heat lingers for quite a while overpowering all other flavors, before eventually fading away into bar soap, musty oak, white pepper, and wet grass. Itâs a funky combination that isnât traditional and itâs just not exactly what Iâm looking for in a bourbon.","Barton has released a wide range of extensions based on its original 1792 Small Batch offering. Prior releases such as Sweet Wheat and Port Finish have been pleasantly surprising, and I had high hopes for a higher proof 1792 release. An often praised brand releasing a high proof, 8.5 year bourbon is something to get exciting about. Mind you I was hoping for this to be a barrel proof offering, but since it was being watered down to 125 proof and offered at barrel entry proof, I figured this was the ideal heat and flavor profile Barton was aiming for this release. Boy was I wrong. Compared to a pour of 1792 Small Batch, this is an amped up version that goes for fire over flavor. Itâs hard to drink this and not notice how off-balancing the heat is. Additionally, the overall flavor profile is underwhelming and leaves a lot to be desired. Sure the palate is really enjoyable, but you have to put up with the lackluster nose and funky hot finish to be able to appreciate it. Barton tried to separate 1792 Full Proof from the pack of other high proof offerings by releasing this bourbon at the same proof as its entry proof was into the barrel. Which when you think about it, is understandable since every brand wants a unique differentiator behind their offering. However after tasting this bourbon and seeing the large focus on the fact that it is coming out at the same proof as itâs going in, almost seems gimmicky to me now considering the flavor profile it presents. It really makes me wonder how unbalanced 1792 really is when dumped straight from the barrel.","$45 for a high proof bourbon that is as high or higher than some barrel proof bourbons doesnât seem too bad on paper. In fact itâs one of the cheaper 120+ proof bourbons on the market. Compared to say Stagg Jrof Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, 1792 Full Proof is less expensive, but then again, those also tend to come in at higher proof points.The truth of the matter is that this is a subpar bourbon that doesnât deliver on the price point. There are a lot of other great bourbons in the $40-$50 price range that I would readily recommend before this. In fact, Knob Creek Single Barrel is also proofed down to almost the same proof, but offers a much more enjoyable drinking experience. This is one of those cases where higher proof doesnât equate to better value in my book.",May 2016,1792 Full Proof
3, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,94.3,NAS, $36 (2016),"Light is the name of the game with this nose. Noticeable light scents of orange, banana peels, vanilla, toasted marshmallows, and oak. There is also the slightest hint of ethanol. The scents presented while unassuming, are subtly sweet and attractive enough to please most.","For being labeled a high rye bourbon, this is sweeter than expected. This isnât necessarily a bad thing, as the light traces of black pepper and rye grain play nicely with sweet dried apples and caramel. No flavor dominates the others, but none is a true standout either.","The subtlest trace of heat starts the finish, which is composed heavily of pepper and rye spice. Itâs not as dominant as other high rye bourbons, but itâs noticeable enough. As the finish goes on, the flavors morph from pepper and rye into a tasty lingering sweet pear flavor with a tad of oak and a smidge of white pepper.","1792 has been on a roll lately with their âlimited expressionâ series. Each one has been a nice play on the standard 1792 Small Batch Bourbon, with this release of High Rye being no exception. While others in the series have presented more of a bold contrast in comparison, this still offers a nice, albeit small variation from the standard expression. If youâre a rye drinker looking for a bourbon that embodies more of ryeâs qualities, this isnât it. However, if youâre a fan of 1792 Small Batch and want a subtle variation, then youâll appreciate what High Rye has to offer.","The great thing about Bartonâs âlimited expressionsâ of their 1792 series, is the fact that theyâve kept prices low. While other distilleries continue to release limited editions with ever increasing prices, Barton has kept this series low in price for anyone to enjoy. This holds true for High Rye, as it comes in at just over $35. While this bourbon isnât setting any new standards for a high rye bourbon, itâs commendable that Barton doesnât overcharge for what is just an average bourbon. Compared to the competition, itâs priced right. However itâs not just other distilleries that itâs competing for attention against, but also the others in the 1792 lineup. With that in mind, even though itâs only priced $5-$10 more than the standard 1792 Small Batch, it still doesnât offer a huge flavor profile difference to justify the increase either.",October 2016,1792 High Rye
4, Straight Bourbon Finished In Port Barrels,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,88.9,NAS, $40 (2016),"Less floral than I was expecting from a bourbon that was finished for two years in used port barrels. After immediately pouring a glass, Iâm treated to hints of light apple, nuts, and charred oak. However, after letting it open up for 10 minutes, the scent profile changes to something quite different. The nuttiness, while slightly noticeable, mellows out and is instead dominated by notes of cinnamon, baking spices, spiced apples, and a faint hint of fresh wood. The nose is pleasant, though I would not guess that this was aged for two years in port barrels based on the scents alone.","While the nose may lull you into believing that this bourbon wasnât finished in port barrels for two years, the palate smacks you right back to reality. The time spent in the port barrels is immediately noticeable as it allowed the bourbon to pick up additional flavors from the wood. A nice viscous mouthfeel is present along with flavors of fruit punch, apples, sugar, and a hint of preserved strawberries; reminiscent of a subtle bourbon sangria. Itâs sweet without being overpowering, however you still realize that you're drinking a bourbon at all times. Really subtle and enjoyable, and a great change of pace from other recent wine barrel finished bourbons.","The nuttiness initially found in the nose reappears in the finish, however not as assertive as before. Instead, it starts more subtle and is mixed together with notes of new oak, caramel, and the preserved strawberries. The finish lingers for some time, with the nuttiness flavor being the main dominant note that carries through."," The uniqueness factor on this bourbon needs to be looked at from two fronts. From the barrel finishing standpoint, the uniqueness is off the chart. No other mass produced bourbon has spent two years finished in wine barrels; usually itâs for a much shorter amount of time. Itâs really interesting to see what happens after allowing the bourbon to age two additional years in the port barrels after spending six years in new charred oak barrels to start. From a flavor perspective, itâs a nice enhancement over the regular 1792. The general nuttiness and base characteristics I find in the standard 1792 still carry over, while the influence of the port barrels is evident without being too overpowering.","At $40 a bottle, this is a great deal for a barrel finished bourbon, especially one that has spent so much additional time in the barrel finishing stage. The closest barrel finished bourbon in price is Michter's Toasted Oak priced at $50. However, these are two very different finished bourbons to compare in terms of barrels used for the finish, time spent in the finishing phase, and flavor profile. Other companies have done wine barrel finishes including High West A Midwinter Nights Dram and Woodford Reserve 2014 Masterâs Collection, however at around $100 each, both bottles retail for two and a half times the price of 1792 Port Finish.",October 2015,1792 Port Finish
5, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,93.7,NAS, $25 (2017),"Rye spice, vanilla, and caramel pull through an undertone of ethanol. A trace of oak lingers underneath. The potency of the ethanol suggests a higher proof than it is, and overall the aroma is unrefined. It doesnât invite me in for a sip, but doesnât quite deter me either.","Thereâs little subtlety here. Rye spice along with sweet vanilla and caramel solidify their presence leaving no other flavors hiding underneath. The mouthfeel is satisfying, as the bourbon is slightly more chewy than average. Like the nose, the potency of the palate also suggests a higher proof than it is. More notably, it comes across as a bit rough around the edges with a sort of âsweet versus spiceâ effect in the sense that the contrasting bold flavors seem to be more in competition with one another than complementing one another. This gives it a dose of character that some may love, while others may hate.","Rye spice, vanilla, and caramel present themselves again in the medium length finish. Spice leads the charge, while the sweeter flavors take over as the flavors decay. Dark fruit makes a brief appearance, but itâs alongside the general âsweetâ note.","1792 Ridgemont Reserve was my go-to bourbon for a long time, and that was when it was packaged differently and had an 8 year age statement that no one took notice of. The age statement was on the back of the bottle, and based on consumersâ attention to bourbon at the time it didnât matter. 8 years, 10 years, 12 years, even 18 years...they were just numbers on bottles and they were plentiful. 1792 was a bourbon that I grew with. It was a bourbon that I had with ice cubes. Then one ice cube. Then a few drops of water. Then neat. It was there for my transition from a casual bourbon drinker to something more.But time has passed and I canât look at it through the same lens I once did. And even if I could, itâs no longer the same. Compared side by side to its 8 year old predecessor the differences are clear. The 8 year old has more depth, more character, and more flavor. But that doesnât change whatâs in the bottle today. 1792 is still what itâs expected to be, and basically what Bartonâs marketing says it is - a bourbon thatâs brash and bold, yet smooth and balanced. Well almost, because itâs not necessary smooth in the sense of the term. So while it lacks the depth it once had, it still manages to distinguish itself from other bourbons in the price range by offering enough character to make it interesting.","At under $30, itâs difficult to say a bourbon is a bad deal. Barton has released a variety of bourbons, all priced at a bargain for what they are. But 1792 Small Batch is always on the shelves just about everywhere and seems like itâs rarely talked about in the community, so it isnât necessarily perceived as a stellar deal. Not to mention there are better bourbons in the price range - Wild Turkey 101 and the slightly more expensive Henry McKenna Single Barrel, for example. But, if itâs your jam, 1792 Small Batch is a staple in the sub-$30 price range, plain and simple. If you havenât tried it yet pick up a bottle and give it a go.",Ongoing,1792 Small Batch
6, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Barton 1792 Distillery,91.2,NAS (Press release states 8 years), $35 (2016),"A very nice blend of young and old wood notes, with lighter punches of black cherry, vanilla, orange, and a slight hint of spice. Itâs not an overpowering blend for a 91 proof bourbon, but it certainly has a good amount of life to it. Not overly complex, but its surface level aromas are hard to dislike.","A well balanced blend of sweet and dry notes that airs on the simple side. The usual bourbon flavors are present with vanilla and caramel being most prevalent. Fainter hints of dried fruit, pine, and walnuts are also noticeable, but have a hard time fully emerging. The bourbonâs soft and creamy mouthfeel is easily its most interesting trait, which helps make this one of the easiest drinkers that Iâve had in some time. While enjoyable, the palate is not immediately memorable.","The creamy mouthfeel thins on the finish and leaves a mildly dry aftertaste. The sweet caramel notes fade giving way to a leathery, oaky, relatively short finish. Itâs an average finish at best that lacks much character.","This one is a little deceiving. Drinking it on its own, fresh out of the bottle, I wasnât blown away. It immediately comes off as an average bourbon. After giving it a few weeks to âbreatheâ in the bottle - while it didnât drastically increase its overall quality - I felt like I enjoyed it much more than my first go around with it.I then tasted it against similarly priced wheaters: Makerâs Mark, Weller 12 Year, and Weller Special Reserve. While Iâd be hard pressed to say it is in the same ballpark as Weller 12 Year, I did enjoy it more than the other two wheaters I compared it against. This was mainly based on 1792 Sweet Wheatâs agreeable nose/palate and its very soft and creamy mouthfeel. In fact, itâs this creamy mouthfeel that ultimately is the bourbonâs most standout trait. It takes its otherwise average(ish) palate and delivers it in a more memorable way. There arenât many bourbons in this price range that have the same seductive mouthfeel as this does.","Being priced at $33 gives the impression that itâs one of the more expensive âeverydayâ wheated bourbons. The thing is, $30 is becoming the new norm for these everyday wheated bourbons. Maker's Mark pricing can be sporadic throughout the country, but the average price is around $30. Weller bourbons - if you can find them - usually start at $30 now. Bernheim hovers around the $30 mark. Larceny is found sub $30, but I personally donât think it matches the quality of 1792 Sweet Wheat. Having the choice at an almost level playing field in the value department, 1792 Sweet Wheat might be my new go-to wheater (of course if weâre excluding Weller 12 Year).",July 2015,1792 Sweet Wheat
7, Bourbon,2Bar Spirits,2Bar Spirits,100,9 Months, $50 (2016),"Bringing the glass of 2Bar spirits up to my nose, I was blasted with a rush of corn. Unfortunately I didnât pick up much else. This has the smell of a young bourbon for sure with lots of the grain present.","2Bar surprisingly had a really good mouth feel after the lackluster nose, in fact, it was almost scotch like. Not surprising, however, is that fact that the grain is very up front and present in the palate. Lingering behind that is very subtle sweet traces of honey and fresh wood. The palate finished with a little burn at the tail end.","While the palate ends on a burn, the finish was something quite different. A strong lingering taste of ripe sweet peaches stays with you. The finish on this bourbon was much longer than I would have expected based on the age and it was real a treat.","2Bar Distillery is one of a number of small upstart distilleries located in Seattle. Itâs the first distillery in Seattle, WA to make 100% local bourbon, meaning that the grains they source are local to Washington and Oregon State. 2Bar is trying to carve out a niche name for itself along with 100âs of other small start-up distilleries popping up around the US. I will say that itâs refreshing to see a distillery use local grains from a part of the US that is more commonly associated with craft beer production than with bourbon."," Like most new distilleries, this Bourbon from 2Bar is priced at a premium. While this may be coming from a young start-up distillery, it still plays in the same space with established players that have been producing bourbon for well over 100 years. At $50, there are many well-known bourbons that blow 2Bar out of the water and the same can be said at even the $35 or $40 price point. I realize they have to pay the upfront costs of the distillery while they age a more mature product, but itâs still hard to swallow paying $50 for just an average bourbon at best.",June 2014 / Ongoing,2bar Bourbon
8, Rye Whiskey Finished in Rum Casks,Angel's Envy / Angel's Share Brands / Louisville Distilling Co. - Purchased by Bacardi Ltd in March 2015,Sourced from LDI now MGP in Indiana,100,NAS (6-7 years old finished up to 18 months), $75 (2016),"Gingerbread, maple sugar candy, and molasses cookies along with an agreeable amount of alcohol burn on the nostrils. It really smells like something you would eat for dessert. Delicious and inviting.","Super sweet. Gingerbread and molasses play off maple sugar candy as the dominant flavor. Sickly-sweet marshmallowy, cotton candy-ish flavors push through towards the end of the sip. The sweetness from the rum casks dominates overall. A trace amount of rye spice is present, but much less so than what would be expected from a 95% rye mashbill. Because of this, itâs easy to sip.","Sugary sweetness lingers. Burnt maple sugar candy and molasses cookies play nicely at first, but then turns back to the sickly-sweet elements hinted on the palate. One of the longer finishes in a whiskey Iâve tasted, it starts nicely but over time morphs into a somewhat off-putting aftertaste. Itâs not bad enough to ruin it, but enough to point out.","Over the past year or so weâve experienced a âFinishingâ explosion. The feedback from the community on the final products has been mixed. At Breaking Bourbon weâve reviewed a number of these finished whiskeys with varied results: High West A Midwinter Nightâs Dram, High West Double Rye Campfire Finish, Jeffersonâs Ocean Aged at Sea 2, Jeffersonâs Ocean Aged at Sea 3, Jeffersonâs Ocean Aged at Sea 4, Michterâs Toasted Barrel Finish, Willett XCF, and Woodford Reserve Masterâs Pinot Noir Finish.With each of the aforementioned finished whiskeys I was fairly excited in anticipation of tasting for the first time, the reason: I wanted and expected to taste something different. As an onslaught of new whiskey labels come to market, few things are worse than spending $80 or more on a bottle of whiskey that doesnât stand out from those available all year for under $30. Although potentially gimmicky or ripe with the risk of tasting terrible (sorry Woodford Pinot Noir Finish), finished whiskeys offer up the possibility of a unique flavor profile that can give enthusiasts the diversity weâre looking for. When I open my whiskey closet I donât reach for my favorite whiskey, I reach for the one that suits my current mood.One thing is important to keep in mind, Angelâs Envy only does whiskey finishing and has been doing it since their inception. To them finishing isnât just a one-off release, itâs what they set out to do with every one of their expressions so far. This particular expression hits the nail on the head when it comes to uniqueness. Rather than imparting just a slight hint of rum flavors, Angelâs Envy pushes the limits and takes it to what might be considered the edge of perfection and (possibly) overdoing it. This is the rub, because fans may find themselves on one side or the other - maybe even teetering back and forth. When I first tasted this I didnât know if I loved it or hated it. Fortunately after about a half bottle later itâs had time to air out. The sickly-sweetness that was overpowering at first has subdued to a manageable level, which has allowed this whiskey to grow on me.","Finished whiskeys receive some of their criticism as a result of their pricing. Like this 6-7 year old sourced whiskey, they are often relatively young, sourced, and arguably over-hyped. The aforementioned list of finished whiskeys weâve reviewed were not cheap, ranging in price from $50 - $140, with most in the $80 - $100 range. Willett XCF is a very close comparison - also sourced from MGP, same mashbill, about 7 years old, and finish-aged for about 90 days (vs. Angels Envy [up to] 18 months). Itâs MSRP is $140. Considering this, the Angelâs Envy Rye is priced to move and based on some peopleâs claims that it is âThe best whiskey theyâve ever hadâ there is certainly a market for it. The [up to] 18 month finishing time is also longer than the norm, suggesting that Angelâs Envy tasters were insistent on achieving what they believe to be the perfect flavor profile even if it takes a little extra time. To further put this duration of finishing into perspective, keep in mind that many craft whiskies arenât even aged for 18 months total!",Ongoing Limited Release / Batch 3,Angel's Envy Finished Rye
9, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,107,7 Years, $55 (2018),"Heavy baking spices, cinnamon bark, and oak up front. While 107 proof isnât exactly low, the ethanol on the nose is very forward and in your face. It doesnât impart a negative experience, however it does make the nose deceive you into thinking it could almost be a barrel proof bourbon. Lingering behind the ethanol is a light trace of vanilla.","Baking spices lead the sip. Theyâre joined with aged oak, leather, a hint of vanilla, and a healthy hit of brown sugar sweetness. Itâs hot, but thankfully drinks more mellow than the nose leads you to believe. A sweet and flavorful sip overall.","The sweetness from the palate carriers over to start the finish. Drier oak, leather, and vanilla merge with a long lingering heat. The heat and dry oak remain while dropping off the sweeter parts. The heat grips your mouth and doesnât let go, bringing you back to believing this is higher proof than the listed 107. Itâs a bold way finish the sip.","Bakerâs is an interesting conundrum. Where Basil Haydenâs and Knob Creek have lost their age statements, Bakerâs continues to hold onto its seven years. After tasting the bourbon, I believe this is partially out of necessity in todayâs marketplace. While it delivers a nice overall sip, thereâs just nothing inherently special about it when comparing it individually to Knob Creek or Bookerâs. When compared to the entire lineup in general, Bakerâs ends up containing some of the sweetness and heat seen in Bookerâs along with the bold flavor profile seen in Knob Creek.Basil Haydenâs is an entryway bourbon for many partly due to its lower 80 proof and appealing bottle design. Knob Creek delivers a bold pour in its standard 100 proof bottling and cranks up the proof for its 120 proof single barrel variant. Bookerâs rounds things out with its 120+ proof offerings. This leaves Bakerâs trying to slot in proof-wise between the standard bottling of Knob Creek and the Single Barrel offering. This all brings me back to its age statement. Without it, one really would just scratch their head and ask why they donât skip this line all together or just bottle another variant of Knob to cover this range. Until that time  happens (if ever) the seven years age statement does help differentiate it among its peers.","Until recently Bakerâs was an overall poor value in the Small Batch Collection. Knob was readily available for $40 and you could get a bottle of Bookerâs for a few dollars more. However now that Bookerâs has been steadily increasing towards a $100 price point, and Knob no longer contains an age statement, the price becomes a little more justifiable when comparing it amongst its Small Batch Collection brethren.That said, the market isnât comprised of just Small Batch Collection bottles. With the recent introduction of Old Ezra 7 Year Barrel Strength being released for $40, things just got a lot more interesting for Bakerâs. Yes Old Ezra delivers a different type of sip, but it canât be overlooked that itâs also has a 7 year age statement, comes in ten proof points higher at 117, and sells for $15 less. It becomes a lot harder to justify Bakerâs all of a sudden. If someone wants a bold flavorful sip with a similar, yet also slightly different flavor profile, you have Knob Creek. If one wants an age stated bourbon thatâs high proofed, you have Old Ezra 7 Year Barrel Strength. Both come in cheaper than Bakerâs and deliver satisfactory drinking experiences.",Ongoing,Baker's Bourbon 7 Year
10, Corn Whisky,Balcones,Balcones,116.6,NAS, $54 (2016),"Not knowing what to expect out of a 100% roasted blue corn whisky, Iâm really surprised at the depth of the nose. As would be expected from a 100% corn whiskey, corn is definitely present however not as much as you would usually find in a younger whiskey. Sweet maple sugar candy immediately jumps out followed by dried corn mixed with aged tobacco, light raisins mixed with pecans, light chocolate espresso, and something I canât put my finger on that is akin to the smell of a fresh poured cask ale. Thereâs no hint of alcohol whatsoever, which is really surprising since itâs bottled at 116.6 proof. It sounds like a strange combination of smells, but the best way to sum up the nose is âdeeply richâ and satisfying. The profile is so different than what Iâm used to with a whiskey, that it kept sucking me back in throughout the review. Really a nice treat and in my mind, the high point of this whiskey.","The palate is sweeter than I expected. Corn is noticeably present, however so are sweet raisins mixed with brown sugar, pecans, and maple syrup, along with a subtle dose of white pepper. Iâm almost tempted to make pancakes one day and pair it with this whiskey. Itâs not quite as sweet as say something like Angel's Envy Rye, however it is definitely sweeter than the nose would lead you to believe. Like the nose, there was barely any alcohol noticeable in the palate which is a nice surprise considering the proof.","This is one earthy dry finish. It starts with bark, aged oak, hints of dark chocolate (think 85% cocoa), aged tobacco, dried leather, and fresh ground green pepper. It then mellows out into just an earthy peppery finish that lingers for a while. Itâs worth noting that the finish is relatively isolated, and started and died in my mouth rather than moving down into my throat or stomach. After the great nose and sweet palate, I was looking forward to the finish, however it didnât live up to the task. Average at best, it doesnât seem to push this whiskey forward as much as the nose and palate.","Balcones isnât the only craft distillery producing a 100% corn whiskey. Among others there is Copper Craft in Michigan, as well as Hudson Distillery with their Baby Bourbon line. That being said, Balcones tastes like nothing else on the market. Iâm not sure if itâs the fact that they use roasted blue corn or that Chip Tate set them up on the road to success, but True Blue Cask Strength is definitely unique like none other Iâve tasted. Similar in sweetness to a watered down Angelâs Envy Rye, the flavor profile produced from a 100% corn based whiskey was really eye opening.Additionally while no age statement is present and this is most likely a younger whiskey (my guess is 18-24 months), I was surprised at the depth of the flavor profile it delivers. Many craft whiskeys in that age range usually donât taste great and rarely match the hype put out by distilleries , however for Balcones True Blue Cask Strength, that doesnât seem to be the case. Compared to other craft whiskeys around the same age, itâs full of deep flavor and really delivers a rich unique taste.","At around $55 youâre taking a gamble on a NAS 100% corn whisky. Yes itâs cask strength, but there are plenty of great bourbons and ryes in the marketplace to grab your attention in that price range. My thoughts on this are similar to Stranahanâs which comes in around the same price. Itâs a craft distilled product that is trying to command a price that isnât in line with current well established whiskey products in the market. Along with Stranahanâs, I would prefer to see this priced at $45 to make it more accessible to those looking to add some variety to their collections.Additionally, Balcones has been in a large state of flux over the last few years. From the Chip Tate saga, to the new distillery, the wild temperature swings of Waco Texas and the types of woods used in their various sized barrels, you should expect a lot of variation between batches. This variation should eventually even out as the new distillery continues to ramp up and Balcones continues to grow its brand. That said, for now youâre taking a gamble when you buy a bottle of True Blue Cask Strength. If you happen to have this at a bar or at a friendâs place and like it, make note of the batch number and try to hunt down a bottle from that same batch.",Ongoing,Balcones True Blue Cask Strength
11, Straight Bourbon,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee),124.7,"8 Years, 3 Months", $90 (2017),"Subtle yet youthful with a slight burn, though less than expected considering the proof. Corn is most prevalent, with hints of caramel, vanilla, cinnamon, and burnt wood fighting vigorously to pull through. The scents are good, just surprising weak overall.","Cinnamon sticks and burnt brown sugar take the forefront. Nestled behind them are peaches, seasoned oak, kettle corn, and a noticeable pop of Atomic Fireball candy. It coats the mouth completely with a viscous mouthfeel. Overall well-rounded with a perfect amount of burn, though still approachable for the proof. Itâs quite enjoyable and has a lively and youthful pep.","Long lasting and quite delicious. Seasoned oak becomes more prevalent here giving the first inclination towards the eight-plus years spent in the barrel. Cinnamon spice lingers unobtrusively, balanced by a dollop of sugary sweetness which dissipates in unison with the cinnamon spice and oak. An outstanding finish overall.","Joe Beatrice, the companyâs founder, has made it the companyâs mantra to provide a unique and different bourbon with every barrel proof batch. While this is the only batch Iâve sampled, I can say itâs unique tasting relative to other bourbons Iâve had. The company claims it is their â...spiciest batch yet,â and with a 26% rye mash bill, itâs no surprise that spice plays the lead role in this bourbonâs cast of flavors. Combined with a 124.7 proof and youthful pep, this bourbon provides a full-flavored, spice-focused, and long lasting sip that will be certain to excite the taste buds of those who experience it. In fact, itâs so spice-forward some might even consider more characteristic of a rye than a traditional bourbon.An interesting aspect of Barrell Bourbon is the concept of offering every batch at barrel proof. This creates a challenge for the company, as water is sometimes necessary to expose the flavors behind the wood or alcohol influence. Incidentally, the bourbon community is thirsty for barrel proof offerings and Barrell Bourbonâs concept is appealing, at least for now. With that in mind, Batch 005 takes a splash of water quite well, taming the spice a bit while still allowing the rich flavors to shine."," $90 for a barrel proof bourbon falls in the higher range of barrel proof bourbons available today. Makerâs Mark Cask Strength, Stagg Jr.,Bookerâs, and Elijah Craig Barrel Proof are popular options that all retail for less, though production numbers are presumably higher than Barrell. Private selections are often barrel proof, and typically range from $50-$80 though consistency and availability vary. On the flip side Angelâs Envy Cask Strength MSRPs for around $170.E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof provides a good price point comparison, coming in about the same as Barrell Bourbon. Incidentally, the prices on both Barrell and Taylor both seem to fluctuate from mid the $60s to around $90 or so depending on the retailer. Taylor has also become quite difficult to find, popping up only once or twice a year and vanishing quite quickly thereafter. Barrell is released in one-off batches, and it does seem to require a bit of searching to locate a bottle, though itâs not impossible.While some may take issue with the fact that Barrell Bourbon is sourced, the quality is present in the final product and the company has been willing to share what they can about each batchâs origin. For me, itâs both delicious and unique tasting, traits that multiply the enjoyment, and value, of a bourbon when found together. While I would not call it a great value as I might with some of the other barrel proof offerings, I wouldnât call it overpriced in todayâs market either. Itâs fairly priced for what it is, and Iâd wager that future batches will occupy shelf space long enough for those who want a bottle to have a good shot at seeking one out, though highly-praised batches will likely move from shelves very quickly.",August 2015,Barrell Bourbon Batch 005
12, Straight Bourbon,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee),122.9,"8 Years, 6 Months", $90 (2017),"Like Barrell Bourbon Batch 005 there is a little burn at first, however unlike Batch 005 after a few minutes it dissipates almost entirely leaving a full-bodied array of pleasant scents behind. Raisins and dark fruit are accented by cinnamon and a hint of citrus, with seasoned oak rounding things out. Itâs rich and inviting, making for one of the best noses Iâve experienced in a while.","Raisins and dark fruit play nicely alongside cinnamon gum. Seasoned wood balances things, providing a prominent undertone throughout the mouth-coating and richly flavored palate. Itâs hard to describe each one individually, but there is a depth of flavors here that pulls through quite prominently. For a bourbon thatâs over 120 proof, itâs surprising how flavor-forward it is beyond the burn, making for an exceptional sip.","Sweet burnt brown sugar tames the cinnamon spice that carries over from the palate, and light seasoned oak notes round things out. A perfect amount of burn and aftertaste that stays true to the rest of the experience. Warming and oh so long, what I wish all whiskey finishes would be. Admittedly I may have said âwowâ out loud a few times, causing my wife to question what I was so excited about.","The companyâs mantra is to provide a unique and different bourbon with every barrel proof batch. Interestingly, this bourbon shares similar roots with the companyâs previous Batch 005 release. It comes from the same undisclosed distillery in Tennessee, shares the same mash bill, is only about 3 months older, and is about the same proof; however it was aged in a lower level of the rickhouse. While I enjoyed Batch 005 so much it made my Favorites of 2015 list, I have to say I actually like Batch 006 better.Tasting them side by side I can pinpoint underlying similarities, but much like siblings, the two batches have come into their own as theyâve aged as the end result is two different bourbons. While Batch 005 is a delicious dose of spice, Batch 006 is much more mellow, providing a rich, deep flavor profile with accents of seasoned oak throughout. Despite Batch 005 and 006 being nearly identical in both origin and age, I actually noticed a good deal more wood influence with Batch 006. Like Batch 005, Batch 006 tastes unlike any other barrel proof bourbon Iâve had.","$90 is a lot for just about any bourbon. While I found Batch 005 to be fair at that price, I find Batch 006 to be of greater value by comparison. While this bourbonâs origin is not overly exciting and itâs only eight and a half years old, that proves to be enough. Itâs value lies very simply in the bourbon within the bottle, a bourbon made for drinking. By comparison, though it doesnât necessarily taste like any of those in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (BTAC) specifically, the quality and experience are within the same range. As a result, I have no hesitation recommending it as an alternative for those unable to find a bottle of BTAC. To put it simply, if you happen to be searching for a high end bourbon at a high end price, Iâm confident you will find it in Barrell Bourbon Batch 006. Act quickly though, as there were only about 5,460 bottles produced.",November 2015,Barrell Bourbon Batch 006
13, Straight Bourbon,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee),122.4,5 Years, $90 (2017),"Scents of grains and sweet corn are at the forefront, wrapped in citrusy orange peel. A sting from the alcohol is present as much as would be expected for the proof. While not unpleasant, its aroma is not overly inviting either.","Spice takes the lead, with a smattering of raw grains and buttery cornbread. It has a nice mouthfeel with a bit of a tingle on the tongue. Sweet citrus and seasoned wood come out from behind the initial flavors leading into the finish.","Nice and spicy. The citrus and seasoned wood that teased the tastebuds on the palate dominate at the start of the finish, making for a nice combination. The seasoned wood progressively overshadows the other flavors as they dissipate, making for a long, dry, and enjoyable finish.","For the first few pours I drank this on its own. However, the spiciness of it reminded me of Batch 005, so I poured some of the last few drops I had of Batch 005 for a side-by-side comparison. To my surprise, I still noticed more spice and a bit more depth with Batch 005.Being of similar heritage, I poured some Batch 006 for a comparison as well. While I noticed echoes of flavor similarities, the lack of refinement with Batch 007 was more evident against the backdrop of Batch 006. At 5 years old compared with 8.5 years thatâs to be expected, though Batch 007âs youth isnât necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it offers a unique comparison with its recent predecessors, almost filling a gap on a flavor profile in a way that allows us to experience different shades of a similar color.","Each batch of Barrell Bourbon has some inherent value simply based on its unique flavor profile, limited production, and careful curation with high level of attention to the details. Barrellâs âevery batch is uniqueâ mantra is both a gift and a curse for the brand, as it is nearly impossible to avoid comparison with the previous batches (immediately passing judgement on value), yet eager fans will be compelled to try the next batch creating an inherent demand. However, as more batches continue to be released, we have to consciously value each individually based on its own merits, not just how it compares to its predecessors. While Batch 007 is not quite the exceptional experience Batch 006 was, it is still a quality barrel proof bourbon packed full of flavor. Despite this, at $90 itâs a tad overpriced, as I would prefer to see it at around $75.

14, Straight Bourbon,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee),132.8,9 Years (9.5 years according to the companyâs website), $90,"Baking spices give way to buttered cornbread and a hint of raw corn. The spices tingle my nostrils, with an expected amount of alcohol for the proof. Pleasant overall.","An interplay between baking spices and buttered cornbread is most prominent. Itâs rather sweet, and offers a healthy amount of spicy heat as might be expected for the proof. Traces of popcorn and seasoned wood come into play towards the end of the sip. Itâs big and bold, delivering the flavors in a straightforward way that should satisfy most barrel proof cravings.","The finish is relatively long lasting, and just as straightforward as the rest of the sip. Baking spices taper off along with buttered cornbread and more prominent seasoned wood towards the end, though itâs less oak influence than you might expect for a 9 year old bourbon. Itâs a nice finish overall that maintains balance with the rest of the sip.","Batch 008 has the same mashbill as Batch 007, and based on what Barrell has shared, a similar origin as Batch 007. While Batch 008 is four years older than Batch 007, the oak influence is no more prominent. The more batches of Barrell Bourbon I try, the more Iâve come to expect similar underlying characteristics. However, the final delivery is unique to each batch. This might just be a good balance, as I have some idea what general characteristics the bourbon might have, but the experience is just different enough from batch to batch to hold my interest. Itâs similar to the range of flavor variation among private selection single barrels of the same brand.The burning question is how this compares with Barrell Batch 006, which is my favorite batch so far and widely recognized as a standout. Batch 006 is more complex, less bold, and its overall delivery is more refined. Batch 008 is more bold, a little more rough in its delivery, and doesnât match the complexity of Batch 006. But itâs still really good, and those who like something a bit bolder might even prefer Batch 008 to Batch 006.","Bourbon prices continue to rise and thatâs OK as long as quality comes with it. For those who enjoy the flavor characteristics of Barrellâs Tennessee sourced bourbons, Batch 008 will not disappoint. Barrellâs bourbons are priced at a premium and as a result shouldnât be confused as everyday drinkers, at least for those of us that consider $90 a lot for bourbon. Itâs a unique tasting bourbon thatâs carefully sourced and carefully curated with quality in mind. Joe Beatrice, the company's founder, has discussed his process with us and the care that goes into it. This is a premium bourbon, and itâs priced accordingly.",July 2016,Barrell Bourbon Batch 008
15, Straight Bourbon,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Tennessee),114.8,6 Years, $90,"Prominent scents of candy corn and buttered cornbread invite a deeper inhale. Breathing in more intensely, the proof is apparent, but hints of ripe bananas and citrus come with it. Itâs quite manageable for the proof, enticing you to have a taste.","Describing it as an explosion of flavor almost doesnât do it justice. Caramel sweetness is balanced against warming cinnamon spice. Rich cornbread, cotton candy, sweet corn, and seasoned oak layer in complexity and depth. Thereâs a ton of flavor here, and itâs diverse in its delivery. Itâs as if you can taste something different every time. Batch 011 is creamy, mouth-coating, and perfectly proofed.","Crisp and clean, the cinnamon spice from the palate dissipates quickly leaving sweet notes of candy corn, a bit of seasoned oak, and echoes of the flavors from the palate. While not the neverending finish you might anticipate from such an explosion of flavor found in the palate, not to mention its high proof, the shorter than expected conclusion leaves you wanting to take another sip.","Each batch of Barrell Bourbon is unique by design. While Barrell Craft Spirits is in the process of getting their own distillation operation up and running, it will be years before they can introduce it into the mix. As a result, the bourbon that makes up each batch is sourced.The company is forthright with much of the information on the spirits they source for each batch, which includes the state of distillation, age, and mashbill in most cases. Because of this, just visiting the companyâs website will tell you that out of 13 batches of bourbon released to date (this includes the 007B and 008B batches), many share similarities. Comparing them with Batch 011, 10 out of 13 were also distilled in Tennessee, with 7 of those sharing the same mashbill. The ages of bourbons sourced from Tennessee range from 5 to 13 years old, with all but one under 10 years.On the surface you might think the âevery batch is unique conceptâ is just marketing. Iâve challenged the idea myself. But compared to the industry as a whole, itâs not uncommon to see many very different products stem from the same distillery and mashbill. The effects of barrel aging, barrel selection, and ultimately the final blend and bottling proof make one bourbon distinct from another. Just compare standard Makerâs Mark with Makerâs Cask Strength; these are two very different experiences separated by the addition of water alone.My point is, while many of Barrellâs sourced bourbons share some underlying similarities, the final experience can vary drastically from one to the next. Batch 011 is a perfect example of this. The culmination of a 2 year long barrel sorting project focused on highlighting exceptional barrels, itâs apparent that Batch 011 shines. Iâve enjoyed every batch of Barrell Bourbon that Iâve tasted so far. Batch 011âs explosive and bright flavors make it a standout, not just among Barrell products, but among bourbons at large.","Barrell Bourbon is priced at a premium; $90 MSRP, though it can often be found for less. Given the fact that each batch is released in fairly limited numbers and at barrel proof, this makes up a bit for the relatively low age of some of the batches, this one included. That said, if the taste is right maybe we can let some of the technicals slide a bit. Barrell nails it with Batch 011, making it worth every penny. If you plan to buy act quickly though, as this bourbon took first place at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition and is sure to be swept off the shelves more quickly than usual.",March 2017,Barrell Bourbon Batch 011

Its partly dry aftertaste is balanced by the bourbonâs sweeter notes creating a finish that is enjoyable and reluctantly assertive.,"How many well-received releases does it take for a product to move away from being the new kid on the block that people have a mild curiosity about, to being a full-blown must buy? How long then before it gains cult status?Barrell Craft Spirits has done a good job with all of their products, making sure no two batches taste alike. Although some could claim thatâs an easy feat when a company procures all of their products from different sources, the harder part is continually offering something thatâs unique tasting and high quality. This is where the majority of new NDP products ultimately fail, as itâs much easier said than done. The company has been on a string of great releases, but more specifically, their bourbon line has continued to be some of the best bourbons on the market batch after batch. Batch 012 might not offer a different tasting flavor profile that turns heads (like Batch 010 did), it simply offers crowd-pleasing flavors that are straightforward and easy to enjoy.","Barrell Bourbon Batch 012 is another quality bourbon that is simply hard to beat for the price. There is always a risk with any bourbon purchase that it might be a letdown, but after 12 releases, there seems to be less risk involved when purchasing a Barrell Bourbon based on the companyâs track record. Where the first few batches of Barrell Bourbon werenât particularly noteworthy, all of the batches weâve reviewed have rated on the high end of our scale. With Batch 012 falling once again right in that same range, debating if $90 is too expensive for these releases is quickly becoming a moot point.",June 2017,Barrell Bourbon Batch 012
17, Bourbon,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From undisclosed distilleries in Indiana and Tennessee),113,Blend of 5 and 8 year old bourbons, $90 (2017),"Equal bouts of toasted almond, leather, and orange comprise this rather interesting nose. There are quick hints of youth that spring up, yet the leather notes provide a solid counterpoint to them. Cocoa and cedar also make ever-so-brief appearances and keep this bourbonâs nose grounded.","A full flavored burst of cigar, tobacco, and seasoned spice. In fact, the spice element unfolds further with notes of anise and cinnamon. Itâs a respectable display of flavors that leans heavily on spicy notes to add a lot of complexity to its palate. The rye grain influence is evident, as there arenât many sweet flavors involved and those that are take a backseat to the spicier ones.","A long and warm finish that introduces black pepper, clove, and an herbal aspect as it trails off. Thereâs a nice amount of burn and the aftertaste stays true to what the palate offers. Overall the finish is a nice companion to the palate as it continues what it started and offers additional layers of complexity.","A lot of bourbons tend to lean on the sweet side of the flavor spectrum. That of course has do with what bourbon is made of (at least 51% corn, often more) and how it is aged. Where older bourbons tend to lose some of their sweetness due to the extended time aging in a barrel, this isnât always the case with younger bourbon. Itâs certainly not uncommon to taste heavier flavor notes of vanilla and caramel in many bourbons aged under 10 years. So when a younger bourbon comes around and those flavors arenât at the forefront, itâs worth taking extra notice.When a company like Barrell Craft Spirits is constantly putting out products that donât have to adhere to a repeatable flavor profile, unique batches are bound to come up. Where Batches 006, 009, and 011 all had very agreeable flavor profiles that almost anyone could love, Batch 013, like Batch 010, stands out for its uniqueness. But this is also a recipe for a large discrepancy of opinions on the bourbon. Batch 013 isnât so odd that bourbon drinkers wonât âget it,â it just doesnât quite conform to traditional expectations for a bourbon with a 5 year age statement on its label.","If âheavy and complex spice notesâ sounds good to you, then Batch 013 will come off as a fair value. If being adventurous appeals to you, then this will be a fair value to you too. If youâre looking for traditional bourbon flavor profile more in line with the rich and agreeable flavors found in other notable Barrell Bourbon batches, then youâll probably not be satisfied with Batch 013âs value. From a high level perspective, Batch 013 is going to be a harder sell for most people. While I wouldnât feel like I got ripped off at its MSRP, $90 for this batch is pushing my personal threshold for whatâs in the bottle despite really enjoying its spicy complexity.",September 2017,Barrell Bourbon Batch 013

A touch of heat shows evidence of the proof. Itâs intriguing and pleasant.,"The sip opens with cane sugar, molasses, and dark cherries - a pleasing combination of sweet, rich flavors. A touch of barrel char along with toasted marshmallows also come into play, countering the sweeter notes. Mouth-coating and noticeably robust, yet not harsh, the palate is a well-developed layering of flavors thatâs as satisfying as it is unique.","Peppery spice kicks in at first, along with a touch of heat. Sweet sugar and toasted marshmallows follow, along with an essense of dark fruit. Long and warming it leaves a delicious aftertaste inviting another sip.","The folks at Barrell continue to impress me time and time again. The first few whiskeys in the Barrell Whiskey line were good, but not whiskeys I felt I would often come back to. With Whiskey Batch 004 a strong rum influence was introduced, and I really liked it. Here with Dovetail, theyâve pulled back on the rum finish in favor of balance, mingling whiskey finished in Cabernet barrels and bourbon finished in LBV Port Pipes and rum casks. LBV meaning âLate Bottled Vintage,â and pipes being essentially long barrels with tapered ends, the result is a layered and rich flavor profile, with an err towards the sweeter side. Barrell succeeds in finding new combination for finishing, yet keeps the resulting flavor profile in check - a result I think many will find appealing and, surprisingly, less polarizing than finished whiskeys can sometimes be.","Barrellâs pricing remains in premium territory, and as a result I never consider it a value play in the same sense as a good whiskey under $30 can be. Instead, take a step back and look at the end product. Itâs uniquely crafted, unique tasting, barrel proof, and delicious. Unlike many non-distiller producer (NDP) brands which simply seek out quality bourbon, Barrell adds unique aspects to the mix. Joe Beatrice, the companyâs founder, has never told me he simply seeks out the best barrels (and keep in mind he is often sourcing from the same distilleries as other NDPs). Instead, the conversation is about the blending. The next experiment. Getting it just right. Like I said, I havenât loved every Barrell Whiskey release, but this one nails it giving us an end product unlike any other.

The aroma is unexpected, offering a solid base of custard sweetness complemented by a touch of rye spice and a hint of smokiness. Itâs full-bodied, but not overpowering. Combined with the welcoming scents, Batch 001 stands out among rye whiskeys.","Sweet cane sugar mingles with a hint of rye spice initially. Warm baked bread, toffee, and butterscotch follow. Thereâs a maltiness to it that creates a base for the other flavors, rounding everything out. All of these flavors are delivered gently, and nicely balance one another. Itâs less potent than the 117 proof would suggest, but still direct. Itâs not quite mellow, but itâs not bold either.","Rye spice pops at first, with youthful rye whiskey flavors making a brief appearance. This is quickly overtaken by a sweet, malty flavor I canât quite pinpoint. While the initial burst of flavors is brief, a delicate sugary-sweet, maltiness lasts for minutes after the sip.","Accordingly to Joe Beatrice, the companyâs founder, Rye Batch 001 contains a high amount of rye from MGP that has a mashbill of 51% rye and 49% malted barley. Based on the flavor profile, itâs obvious that this is the predominant component in the blend.The resulting flavor profile offers a new experience thatâs still built off of familiar flavors. The rye elements are straightforward, and the malt brings balance to the table. Tasted next to a barrel proof Smooth Ambler Single Barrel Rye and a Thomas H. Handy Rye, the balance Batch 001 offers is even more obvious. Also evident by this comparison is the lack of Batch 001âs WOW factor. I really enjoy the discernible malt characteristics, but this addition seems to tame some flavors as much as it brings something new to the table. Iâd wager that some will find it balanced to a fault, while others will revel in its subtle uniqueness.As this is sourced and blended with barrels from Indiana and Tennessee, and the predominant component is the high barley malt rye from MGP, itâs possible we might see more ryes hit the market with the same MGP mashbill very soon. In talking with Beatrice, the MGP rye on its own was a bit too malty, which prompted the addition of the Tennessee rye to the blend. While the malty characteristic is what makes this rye unique now, only time will tell if the addition of Tennessee rye to Batch 001 might be the dark horse that separates it from the pack in the future. ","Rye whiskeys are becoming increasingly popular and weâre seeing more of them introduced to the market. MGPâs 95% rye whiskey can be very good, but itâs also quite common as itâs bottled under numerous labels. Most rye mashbills are either all rye, close to it, or have almost as much corn as rye in the mashbill. Established companies tend to offer at least one rye in their product portfolios, and they vary from straightforward flavor profiles with mass appeal, to those that offer something unique that might appeal to fewer consumers but push the boundaries of flavor. Craft distilleries are also increasingly experimenting with ryes with varied results. Still, there are far fewer ryes than bourbons to choose from, and barrel proof ryes are even less common. To that end, Barrellâs offering of a unique tasting, nicely blended, limited production barrel proof rye for a premium price of $85 is more than Iâd like it to be, but not unreasonable in todayâs marketplace. After tasting it, I donât feel the urge to stockpile it, and because of its unique flavor profile along with its price, it might not be an impulse buy for most.",July 2017,Barrell Rye Batch 001

A hint of smoke is also present. The proof is hidden behind the rich scents, though a trace of ethanol peeks through. Interesting and inviting.","Chocolate, tobacco leaves, lightly roasted malt, and seasoned oak alongside sweeter butterscotch and anise notes are the first to grab my attention. They fold over one another comprising the base. A smoky element further complements these flavors, and is joined by a nuttiness which helps round things out. The proof is well hidden, but shows through in the richness of the sip. It offers a creamy mouthfeel, making for a superb palate.","Spice pops first in the long finish, with raisins and anise lingering after the initial spike. By comparison, the finish is less complex than the palate, but still enjoyable overall.","According to company founder Joe Beatrice, American Vatted Malt is a project long in the making. It includes components from all over the country, some of which are from up-and-coming distilleries. The age of single malts in the vat ranges from 1.5 - 8 years. Single malts have deep roots in scotch. However, in the United States, the category could still be described as âup-and-comingâ despite being around for quite awhile. Malt whiskey is defined as containing at least 51% malted barley and must be stored in new charred oak containers, similar to bourbonâs 51% corn and new charred oak storage requirement. Rye malt, straight malt, and straight rye malt are also further defined, extrapolating from the definition of malt whiskey. American single malt whiskey however, is not defined officially in the regulations. Because aging malt whiskey in used cooperage is often favored when using the cereal grain, the components within this blend donât necessarily qualify as malt whiskeys by United Statesâ current definition. As a result of this lack of definition within the regulations, producers have joined together to more clearly define the category, creating the American Single Malt Whiskey Commission.While we have experienced a growing âmalt whiskeyâ category in the United States, it has been predominantly craft distilleries and limited distribution. However, distilleries such as Stranahanâs out of Denver, Colorado and Westland out of Seattle, Washington have made malt a focal point, producing whiskeys that have been well-received and become more widely distributed. In 2015 Heaven Hill released Parkerâs Heritage Collection Straight Malt Whiskey, an 8 year 108 proof straight malt whiskey with a 65% malt, 35% corn mashbill which offered a flavor profile that was hard to dislike, though relatively safe within the space. The only current major U.S. distillery releasing an ongoing malt whiskey is Brown-Forman, with their Woodford Reserve Straight Malt Whiskey. While malt whiskey has grown more common (or at least the use of higher percentages of malt in the mashbill), blending or âvattingâ from a wide range of distilleries, however, is not so common in the United States. Notably, blending is Barrell Craft Spiritsâ strength, and itâs showcased very well here with the resulting depth and complexity of flavors captured with this whiskey.","While some simply take anotherâs product and bottle it with little attention to blending, Barrell Craft Spirits excels at meticulously blending base component whiskeys to create something better. While I canât necessarily compare the base whiskeys used in this blend to the final product, I can say with confidence that the final product is a good one. Talking with Beatrice, like anything new and a bit different, he was unsure how it would be received. However, he also believes the American single malt category has a lot of potential. He noted many craft distillers come from the beer industry, where they are often experienced working with malted grains, which are generally forgiving to begin with. Of the quality malt-based whiskeys Iâve had, the pricing has generally been $50 or more. Higher proof options are much less common than their bourbon and rye counterparts, and often come with an increase in price. While American Vatted Malt includes a component that is as little as 1.5 years old, the components run up to 8 years. The percentages are not disclosed by Barrell, but there isnât any indication of youth in the sip. Ultimately, while Vatted Malt is premium-priced at $90, it delivers.",,Barrell Whiskey American Vatted Malt
21, Whiskey,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Indiana),122.5,7 Years, $60 (2017),"Before even bringing this up to my nose Iâm immediately suspicious of what I just poured. I had to do a triple take as this is an incredibly light colored whiskey, which is reminiscent of a white whiskey aged for just a short time in a new barrel. That being said, the nose reminds me that this isnât just one step removed from white whiskey.The nose is surprisingly mellow for a 122.5 proof whiskey, with just the slightest amount of alcohol present. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is I found myself inhaling hard to distinguish the subtle scents that seemed to settle at the bottom of the glass. Barley, fresh baked bread, toffee, and the ever slightest hints of vanilla and caramel are all present. Not horrible by any means, however for being 122.5 proof Iâm shocked that the scents donât come across deeper than they do, and at how much I really have to work to distinguish the ones that are present.","While the nose didnât build my confidence, the palate is surprisingly sweet and delivers a really nice taste. The sweetness is comprised of maple syrup, french toast, and powdered sugar that are mixed with pronounced lush dark fruits. These are all topped off by a dab of heat, that allows all the flavors to meld together in a delicious flavor profile. This is one whiskey that youâll spend awhile on picking apart the various flavor components hidden inside.","The finish starts off really hot and then quickly fades to a mellow heat that dies over the next minute or so. The upfront heat is contained to my mouth and presents with it tastes of watermelon influenced fruit punch. As the heat fades away flavors of fresh marshmallows, dark cherry chocolate, and baked desserts are all noticeable over the next minute or so. From here, the finish mellows out into a one-dimensional flavor that lasts several minutes. This isnât necessarily a bad thing as I found myself reminiscing of sipping on a cherry cream soda for several minutes after taking a sip.","The companyâs mantra is to provide a unique and different whiskey with every batch. While this is their first batch of whiskey and I had nothing to directly compare it to, it has one of the more unique flavor profiles for a whiskey. It isnât mind blowing, however the palate pairs the sweetness with the dark fruits really well and the finish keeps delivering long after you finish taking a sip. Additionally, very few whiskeys either bourbon or otherwise are bottled at barrel strength and are neither charcoal or chill filtered.I went back and added a few drops of water after my tasting to see how it affected the whiskey. The water actually muted the initial flavors a little bit while shortening the finish. This is one whiskey that Iâd definitely recommend you drink for a little bit before considering adding any water or ice to it. The 122.5 proof is very manageable and not nearly as âstrongâ as youâd expect from a whiskey this high in alcohol.","Coming in at $60 for a NDP whiskey aged in used bourbon barrels, this certainly isnât an inexpensive whiskey. Youâre getting a blended whiskey from an undisclosed source that looks like it was aged for a few months let alone the 7-8 years it actually spent in the barrel. That being said, there also arenât that many unique tasting barrel proof whiskeys on the market that offer a manageable amount of low heat along with an approachable flavor profile. While not the best deal on the market, there are certainly many worse whiskeys available out there for a similar or even higher price. When you look at it that way, $60 doesnât seem too bad after all.",July 2015,Barrell Whiskey Batch 001
22, Whiskey,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Indiana),123.8,9.5 Years, $60 (2017),"Immediately upon pouring a glass, a noticeable heavy coat of ethanol hangs over the nose of this whiskey and reminds me of its presence every time I inhale. In order to fully enjoy this, I recommend giving this whiskey 5-10 minutes to breathe and let the alcohol dissipate. After giving this time to breathe, I find oak, leather, graham cracker, light vanilla, and dried figs. The flavors play nicely enough, however the initial upfront and lingering alcohol scent does a disservice to the nose, muting its overall potential.","After the nose, it should come as no surprise that this palate drinks to its proof, bringing an ample yet still manageable amount of heat. Light in mouthfeel, the palate consists of a hit of sweet vanilla upfront immediately followed by aged oak, dry leather, spiced raisins, rye spice, and a hint of creamy sherry from the finishing. Overall, the palate contains a nice mix of flavors and is able to balance out the heat nicely.","The heat carries through from the palate and really unleashes itself in the finish, however itâs contained only in my mouth. The sherry finishing shines through the brightest in the finish, with heavy creamy sherry notes carrying through and dominating the finish upfront. After a while, hints of vanilla and raisins also appear. Eventually the finish dies out into a mix of aged oak, dry nuts, and a remaining hint of creamy sherry, which is nice, but not as pleasant as the first half of the finish.","I am a fan of Barrell Whiskey Batch 001. Itâs well balanced with a great flavor profile that drinks below its 122.5 proof. While unique in itâs own right, Batch 002 isnât as dynamic of an experience for me. Yes this may not be a fair apples to apples comparison and the sherry cask finish imbued a nice flavor profile, however the extra 1.3 proof points adds a noticeable amount of heat, which seems to detract from the overall drinking experience comparatively. Additionally, while the flavors in Batch 002 are very pleasant, to me they do not deliver the rich, delicious flavors found throughout Batch 001.A fairer comparison would be comparing Batch 002 to other barrel finished whiskeys. While the sherry cask finishing is noticeable, its influence is not as prominent as other barrel finished whiskeys such as Angelâs Envy Rye or High West Double Rye Manhattan Finish. This could be due to the overall length the whiskey spent in the sherry casks, which Barrell Spirits has not disclosed for this release. While I prefer barrel finished bourbons to really highlight the finishing barrel used, others may actually enjoy this due to the subtle nature of how the sherry cask influences the whiskey without completely dominating the flavor profile.It should be noted that I went back after the review and added a few drops of water as was suggested on Barrellâs website. While the nose remained unchanged, the sherry finishing became more apparent in the palate and finish, along with rye spice poking its way into the finish. Overall I didnât notice too much of a difference in the flavor profile and would recommend drinking it however you prefer.","A cask strength whiskey just shy of 10 years old that was finished in sherry casks for $60 seems like a great value on paper. In fact compared to other barrel proof whiskeys finished in a second alcohol barrel, this is priced excellently. That said, while the flavor profile is good, I feel like this whiskey doesnât live up to its truest potential. It almost plays it safe by dampening the influence of the sherry cask finish, which in turn tends to dampen the overall experience.Thatâs the thing with Barrellâs products though, youâre never quite sure what youâre going to get. While Batch 001 is priced the same, it felt like I was drinking two whiskeys worlds apart. While itâs unfair and unnecessary to expect Barrell to price different batches based on comparisons to predecessors, consumers need to be aware that the batch variation along with personal taste preferences will dictate value on a batch-by-batch, person-by-person basis.",April 2016,Barrell Whiskey Batch 002
23, Whiskey,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced (From undisclosed distilleries in Indiana & Tennessee),120.6,11 Years, $65 (2017),"Fresh baked gingerbread cookies engage the senses, with sweet brown sugar, toasted orange peel, and big rye spice rounding things out. Itâs assertive and appealing, suggesting a bold and exciting sip lies ahead.","Spicy rye and peppery seasoned oak build structure around sweet molasses and raw cane sugar. Thereâs a sweetness thatâs reminiscent of Dr. Pepper or root beer, but it draws a balance with what is otherwise a more whiskey-forward base of flavors. This includes the more typical caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, and oak elements. The layers and depth of flavors are evident on the palate and really enjoyable, signalling the complex process of finishing and blending that was undertaken in order to bring this whiskey together.","Hands-down a pleasing finish, Dr. Pepper sweetness and candied citrus lead the charge. Burnt rye spice and black pepper add dimension. The big flavor lasts for a short amount of time, but leaves a lingering sweetness behind making for a medium-length finish that turns a bit dry towards the end.","When I last spoke with Joe Beatrice, the companyâs founder, he was notably excited about this particular release. While each of his barrel finished whiskeys has been interesting, this one seems to take things to a new level.Starting with a bourbon from Tennessee and a whiskey from Indiana, and then finishing in two different types of used spirits barrels for a combination of four different whiskeys to make up the blend sounds gimmicky, but turns out really intriguing. I canât say with certainty something similar has never been done before, but I can say the complexity of this level of finishing and blending goes beyond the norm.While the end result of experimentation can often be a letdown, Barrell Whiskey Batch 004 is anything but. Introducing a rum cask finished component is the most interesting aspect of this blend, but also the most risky. To draw a comparison, Angelâs Envy Finished Rye takes a base of 95% rye whiskey and lays a rum cask finish overtop. After up to 18 months of finishing, the rye characteristics are almost entirely eclipsed by rum sweetness. Not surprisingly, the ending result is a highly polarizing product.Alternatively, Barrellâs process yields a much different end result and one I think will appeal to a wider audience of whiskey enthusiasts. Unlike Angelâs Envy, Whiskey Batch 004 draws a much better balance with rum sweetness, resulting in a flavor profile that builds off a base of whiskey with complimentary, albeit assertive, rum sweetness balanced against the structure of rye spice. The length of finishing time, inclusion of ex-rye barrel finished whiskeys in the blend, and the fact that the rum barrels used did not include any added sweeteners (as rums often do) are all factors in the equation leading to the end result. Regardless, the proof is in the pudding as evidenced by the whiskeyâs flavor profile.","Barrell whiskeys are priced less than Barrell bourbons, providing evidence of the power of the âbourbonâ classification in todayâs marketplace. As each Barrell batch is a unique expression and released in reasonably limited quantities, availability is always a limited engagement. This particular batch of whiskey is a tremendous product thatâs both unique and enjoyable, and as a result offers good value, even at its premium price point.",March 2017,Barrell Whiskey Batch 004
24, Whiskey,Barrell Craft Spirits,Sourced from numerous undisclosed distilleries,119.3,NAS, $70 (2018),"Each time I pour a glass I seem to pick up different aromas - and each time the aromas seem to lead me down a slightly different path that becomes prominent for that specific pour. Itâs almost as if the whiskey presents veins of unique scents and flavors that once identified become impossible to ignore, overshadowing the others that are present but more prominent at different times. In all cases the aromas are characteristically sweet, with gingerbread and hints of molasses and maple sugar candy. A grainy rye presents itself at times, and hints of malt are also present. There are traces of ethanol as well, but the intensity seems to vary each time. The scents are layered and complex but subtle at the same time.    ","Like the aromas on the nose, the palate seems to vary a bit each time I have a pour, sending me down uniquely different paths. Most notably it tastes characteristically like whiskey. Not bourbon, not scotch, not rye, not Irish whiskey...but rather the broad category of whiskey where just about anything goes. Like the nose, sweeter notes do seem to be most prominent, with hints of fruit, caramel, and creme brulee. I notice a good amount of seasoned oak at times, but itâs never characteristically woody. A trace of scotchy maltiness finds a presence as well, while at other times there seems to be a vein of rye spice that cannot be ignored. Itâs well integrated, but does still taste like a mashup of sorts. Like Hillrock Solera Aged Bourbon, the integration and nuanced flavors are quite subtle and lie beneath the surface, requiring deeper exploration than usual to appreciate.","The finish seems to be the most consistent, where the flavors seem to normalize regardless of how they present themselves at times throughout the rest of the experience. Sweetness generally dominates at first, followed by a hint of maltiness along with a lingering rye spice against the sweeter notes. Itâs a nice finish leaving me wanting to take another sip.","Needless to say, this concept is a unique one. While many of us have infinity bottles at home, Iâve yet to see a producer turn the concept into an ongoing release. Sure there have been collaborations and blends, but no one to my knowledge has attempted to integrate such a wide range of different whiskeys into an ever changing release.When I asked the companyâs founder Joe Beatrice what to expect out of this, he said to âexpect the unexpected.â I didnât know what it would taste like and the flavor profile, it turns out, is one I canât quite seem to pin down. Like my own infinity bottle, this first release of Infinite Barrel Project Whiskey is a mashup of many different flavors. But unlike many evolutions of my own infinity bottle, the Infinite Barrel Project tastes good.What stands out the most about this first Infinite Barrel Project release is how the underlying nuanced scents and flavors seem to present themselves at different times. As any experienced whiskey drinker knows, a particular whiskey can taste a little different at different times given the time of day or what you might have had to eat or drink before it - not to mention that first pour from the bottle as compared with a later pour after itâs had a little time to air out. In this case, the extent of flavor variation from pour to pour and day to day was more pronounced than usual. It seems fair to attribute this to the fact that there are so many whiskeys in the blend, ultimately resulting in a more complex and layered whiskey than most. To that end, itâs been a fun whiskey to explore.","The Infinite Barrel Project is going to be an ongoing release - each new dump will be denoted by the bottling date on the label with further details provided on the companyâs website. Considering the volume for each release will likely be reasonably small, Barrell probably could have priced this at a premium relative to their standard Barrell Whiskey releases. But they didnât. While itâs still released at a premium price point in the marketplace, $70 MSRP, itâs certainly not over the top. Considering this is the first release, the Infinite Barrel Project is a must-buy for Barrell fans who will undoubtedly want to compare it to future releases to experience the changes over time. For those not necessarily interested in the concept itself, at face value itâs still a one off unique tasting barrel proof whiskey.",May 2018,"Barrell Whiskey: Infinite Barrel Project - February 12, 2018 Release"
25, Bourbon,Diageo/Orphan Barrel Whiskey Distilling Co.,Bernheim,90.2,20 Years, $75 (2014),"Sweet and pleasant upon first whiff. Oak, cherries, creme brulee and vanilla dominate.  Itâs a lethal combination for anyone with a sweet tooth. Itâs not incredibly deep but very nice.","Dry oak hits first with caramel, cherry and vanilla following. Not as sweet tasting as the nose suggests and not as oaky as the age suggests. It doesnât have a very complex palate, yet what it offers is very enjoyable.","Thin, smooth and short which partly has to do with the 90.2 proof point. Definitely on the sweeter side. Enjoyable but over too quickly.","There are two sides to this coin. The first is the background side. Diageo doesnât operate a bourbon distillery. They source the bourbon for their Bulleit brand from Four Roses and the Bulleit Rye from MGP in Indiana. They also own the mothballed Stitzel-Weller distillery where they store barrels from many out-of-business bourbon distilleries. They have begun to tap into these stocks and are branding the bourbon that comes from them the Orphan Barrel Whiskey Project. Barterhouse is the first release in this new brand.Even though there are in the range of 50,000 Barterhouse bottles in this first release, this is a very unique and rare release. There is a finite number of bottles Diageo can pull from and itâs only a matter of time before Barterhouse is gone forever.The other side of the coin is the bourbon itself. Every bourbon on the market has something about it that makes it taste unique. Itâs a bourbonâs finer points that make it memorable. Barterhouse is easy-drinking and very pleasant, it just doesnât have enough to make you really remember it. Youâll enjoy your experience with it, but wonât feel the need to stockpile it.","On paper, $75 for a 20 year old bourbon is within the range of acceptability. Elijah Craig released a 21 year bourbon at the end of 2013 for $150. As part of their annual Antique Collection, Buffalo Trace released an 18 year old rye and a 19 year old bourbon for $70. The Parker Heritageâs 2013 release was a 10 year old bourbon that sold for around $100. As always though, age doesnât mean a thing if the bourbon doesnât taste good.Barterhouse has a very pleasant taste but its low proof and watered down palate do the bourbon a disservice. You could probably say any bottleâs palate would be better served at an above 100 proof point. Markerâs Mark could be infinitely better at a higher proof point. âWhat ifsâ are simply rhetoric. What you're reviewing is the bottle in hand. Did I feel drinking Barterhouse that I paid too much? Yes. Did I feel ripped off? No. The bourbon is just unique enough to put the value of Barterhouse in the acceptable range.",March 2014,Barterhouse
26, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,80,10 Years, $60 (2019),"The nose brings doses of summer fruits and oak. Additionally, thereâs a light hint of honeyed vanilla added to the mix. The aroma is less floral than I find standard Basil Haydenâs to be, with oak coming through more predominantly. Sadly, the low proof results in a lack of overall depth.","The palate continues to be light due to the 80 proof that Beam bottles this at. The good news is that this lower proof really allows you to roll the sip around in your mouth for a long time to try to pick out flavors. The bad news is that oak and sweet vanilla form the entirety of the palate, which isnât what youâd expect from a 10 year old bourbon.","Like its younger sibling, Basil Haydenâs 10 Yearâs finish is short and almost nonexistent, ending almost as soon as it starts. Light oak dominates with an ever-so-slight touch of sweetness. For a 10 year old bourbon the lack of depth is surprising and unfortunate.","Itâs great to see Basil Haydenâs add an age stated bottle to their lineup. In 2014 Beam removed the 8 year age statement from Basil Haydenâs making it a no age statement (NAS) bottling, instead labelling it âArtfully Aged.â Itâs now rumored to be bottled at around 6-7 years old. An extra few years would hopefully bring some needed definition to Basil Haydenâs flavor profile.While I didnât have an old 8 year old bottle of Basil Haydenâs to compare it against, I did compare it side by side with the standard NAS bottling. Surprisingly, all around the 10 year variant was lacking compared to the NAS bottle. It would have been great if Beam took this opportunity to also up the proof even if only 10 points to help enhance the sip. Instead youâre left with a bourbon that fades into an over-crowded field faster than you can blink an eye.","On its own a 10 year old bourbon for $60 isnât completely out of line with todayâs market pricing. However once you add in the fact that this bourbon is only 80 proof and delivers a completely underwhelming experience, the price tag now becomes concerning. While a limited release can usually justify a higher price tag, you have to actually deliver on the bourbon in the bottle. In this case Basil Haydenâs 10 Year falls way short. Yes itâs only about $15 more than a standard Basil Haydenâs bottle, but a 25% markup is just not able to be justified here.",December 2018,Basil Hayden's 10 Year Bourbon
27, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,80,NAS, $45 (2019),"Bright peaches and ripe mixed berries jump right out. Further hunting brings forth light traces of oak, orange zest, and a smidge of white pepper. The scents are on the lighter side overall due to the low proof, yet theyâre still easy to identify and appreciate.","The palate is understandably light due to the 80 proof that Beam bottles this at. Light vanilla, new wood, and peaches mingle together and form the entirety of the palate. While the 80 proof makes this incredibly easy to sip, the mouthfeel is noticeably thin, and even at the bottling proof, this seems lighter than average. A few additional proof points would have gone a long way to deepen the palate. ","The finish is short and almost nonexistent, and ends almost as soon as it starts. Oak, light summer fruits, and a touch of corn grain along with new leather are present, but only after really hunting to find them. Itâs reminiscent of a really watered down whiskey, which many would argue at 80 proof, that this is all it really is.","Basil Haydenâs is different in many ways from the other bottles in the Small Batch Collection. Positioned as a premium gateway bourbon, itâs proofed a whole 20 points lower than its next lowest sibling, Knob Creek. Additionally, it uses a different mashbill than the rest. One trait it does share with Knob Creek and Bookerâs Bourbon, is that it also lost its age statement (8 Year) in 2014. Itâs rumored to be bottled at a higher age than Old Grand-Dad, but without an actual age statement itâs hard to trust much in that rumor.The one saving grace is that the higher rye content does however give it a different and more easily approachable flavor profile than the rest of the Small Batch Collection, albeit even if itâs extremely weak. The assumption is that Beam is trying to appeal to new bourbon drinkers who are looking for a flashier looking bottle with a lower proof. While Basil Haydenâs may win on style points, there are plenty of other bourbons on the market that offer an approachable entry level experience at a much better price.","A slick bottle design and easy sip position Basil Haydenâs to be a good gateway bourbon, yet its MSRP is a still a head scratcher. The lowest proof in Beamâs Small Batch Collection, it carries quite a premium price tag for a non-age stated 80 proof bourbon. For a few dollars less you can get a fuller flavor Knob Creek or for about the same price, you can get a Knob Creek Single Barrel, which offers an exceptional value for what it delivers. Logical reasoning would go that Beam would hook people in with a easy to drink low proof bourbon at a lower price tag and get consumers to move up the value chain with higher proof bolder bourbons as their palates and curiosities expand. However, Beam takes the opposite approach with Basil Haydenâs pricing.On top of that, if you love the Jim Beam high rye mash bill but want a higher proof, you can always pick up a bottle of Old Grand-Dad 114 for less. Yes, Old Grand-Dad is often overlooked on shelves due to its association as an old manâs bourbon, but thatâs really a shame since the bourbon is just as approachable. Sure Basil Haydenâs comes in a bottle that conveys a much more premium product versus the Old Grand-Dad line, but a great bottle design shouldnât equate to an inflated MSRP.",Ongoing,Basil Hayden's Bourbon
28, Distilled Spirits Specialties (Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey Blended with Canadian Whiskey and Port),Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,80,NAS, $40 (2017),"Fresh oak and dark berries dance in the forefront. Beneath are fresh baked fruit turnover, rye spice, and a hint of green apple. While the scents arenât the rye notes I was expecting, theyâre quite inviting and and set the tone for just how different this blended rye is going to be.","Thereâs a clear influence from the port on the palate. Itâs sweet, consisting of a big bowl of berries and plums with a hint of vanilla dominating the sip. Itâs far from dry, with the best way of describing this palate as juicy. The rye is drowned out as the port influence clearly dominates. That said, this is dangerously easy to sip due to its sweet flavor profile and low proof.","If you love classic rye finishes, youâve come to the wrong place, as the port continues to impact here too. The dark berries found in the palate linger, and carry through the entire finish. Adding to them is a nuttiness that is combined with white pepper and oak. Thereâs a very light hint of rye spice, but itâs easily overpowered by the other flavors. Unfortunately, the funky nutty taste lingers long after the other other flavors and overstays its welcome. Frankly the finish is a letdown compared to the nose and palate.","Itâs becoming more and more common to see flavored âwhiskey liqueursâ that are under 80 proof points. Wild Turkey and Evan Williams are good examples of this, having released various honey, cinnamon, and other infused whiskeys. Whatâs not common is the practice of major U.S. whiskey distillers directly adding other alcohol types, like wine, to their mix of 80 proof plus spirits. This practice could be construed as a distillery taking the easy route when it comes to flavoring, or worse, trying to hide a flawed product with a stronger flavoring agent.As one of the largest and longest established distilleries, itâs ironic that Beam embraces the direct addition of port, as opposed to finishing the rye in wine barrels. I might expect this from an upstart distillery working with a minimal budget and trying to be unique, but not necessarily a large and established one. Past products including Jim Beam Signature Craft Rare Spanish Brandy which has Spanish brandy added to the mix and Alberta Rye Whiskey Dark Batch. The latter is made up of a mix of 100% Canadian rye, Old Grand Dad, and Spanish sherry (91% rye whiskey, 8% bourbon, and 1% sherry). These products share similar traits as Basil Haydenâs Dark Rye, in that the added spirit is extremely noticeable much more so than you might find in typical barrel finished products.In the end, just because Beam goes the route of adding the port directly to Basil Haydenâs Dark Rye doesnât mean that theyâre necessarily doing anything wrong. Yes it will deliver a flavor profile that wonât please everyone, but itâs also a fascinating example of how the addition of another spirit can influence a mass produced whiskey versus barrel aging or barrel finishing. While I donât advocate for this becoming a trend anytime soon, itâs a unique way to bottle a whiskey, and one that provides a flavor profile unlike almost anything else currently on the market.","Itâs hard to judge the value of a whiskey when it has so few similar competitors. $40 for a blended rye that has port added to it may sound like a lot, but in this case, I feel that itâs actually priced quite reasonably. In today's marketplace where anything labeled as a limited yearly release seems to be marked up beyond necessity, Jim Beam has decided to keep this reasonably priced. With Dark Rye coming in at the same MSRP as Basil Haydenâs Bourbon, itâs a great experiment by Beam to price an outside-the-box release at an everyman's price. This is the opposite route of what competitors do, such as the yearly Brown-Forman release of their limited edition Woodford Masterâs Collection for $100. Even Beam does this with their own Knob Creek line when it comes to limited editions. While in the end this bourbon might not be worth paying much more than a few dollars over MSRP due to the funky finish, itâs incredibly refreshing to see the price point Jim Beam landed on this one.",September 2017,Basil Hayden's Dark Rye
29, Blend of Straight Bourbon & Straight Rye Whiskey,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,80,NAS (Blend of 5 and 7 year old ryes plus 6 and 13 year old bourbons), $45 (2018),"Oak, rye spice, and banana are the predominant scents with brown sugar and vanilla lingering underneath. Unfortunately, the low proof of Two by Two Rye really makes you work to find the scents. The aromas arenât bad individually, but the way they come together makes them seem more muddled than defined which brings down the whole experience.","A touch of sweetness along with oak are the predominant flavors in the sip. In addition, it contains light traces of vanilla, bubble gum, and unsalted peanut butter. I was also surprised to see a lack of any rye influence in the sip. The good news is that the low proof allows you to swirl this around to hunt out flavors. The bad news is that the flavors that are present arenât worth hunting out. Overall the palate seems more jumbled than not.","Slightly tannic, the first descriptor that pops into my head is mushy oak. The finish is dry, with none of the sweetness from the nose or palate present. In addition to prominent oak, traces of dry leather and the faintest hint of dry nuts are mixed in. The flavors fade quickly and leave a dry coating of stale oak that lingers far too long.","It was only a few short years ago that bourbon rye blends came to market. Some with a âtaleâ of how they were accidentally blended such as the first release of Wild Turkeyâs Forgiven, others such as High West Bourye that were done on purpose. Nowadays itâs getting more common to see bourbon rye blends on the market, each with their own twist. Wild Turkeyâs Forgiven contained one rye and one bourbon, and High West Bourye contained four blended whiskeys, three of them were rye and one was a bourbon. With Two by Two Rye, Beam slightly changes that formula to two ryes and two bourbons without providing detailed information on those mashbills or blend percentages.In this case while the resulting flavor profile is far from unique, the blend they decided to go with is at least new. Credit should be given for being innovative and trying something new, although it does beg one to wonder why stop at two by two, why not three by three or four by four? Maybe that will be a 2019 trend, but I digress. With Two by Two Rye, you would hope that a unique blend came with a unique flavor profile. Unfortunately from start to finish the experience seems muddled and doesnât quite come together.","From a purley blended rye standpoint, itâs certainly much cheaper than the two closest yet not quite equal bottles on the market, which would be High West Bourye and Jeffersonâs Chefâs Collaboration. However in terms of flavor I still walk away feeling like I paid much too much for the sip that is delivered by this blend. It comes across as more haphazard than refined and drives home the point that just because a limited release may be priced low in comparison to the rest of the market, doesnât mean that youâre getting a good value for your money.",July 2018,Basil Hayden's Two by Two Rye
30, Distilled Spirits Specialties (8 year old Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey Blended with 4 year old Canadian Whiskey and Black Strap Rum),Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,80,NAS, $45 (2019),"Sweet rich molasses notes are instantly noticeable and quite dominating. Inhaling deeply reveals trace amounts of oak, vanilla, and random touches of blueberries. Due to the low proof and the fact that the molasses scent is so dominating, it would be hard to discern what this is if handed to you blindly. The nose shows that itâs clearly not rum, but it also doesnât come across as a rye either. Itâs a non-traditional nose thatâs surprisingly quite funky and fun.","An overly sweet molasses note hits first and comes across as slightly artificial. Like the nose, molasses dominates, but is now mingled with wet oak, baking spices, and a hint of vanilla. The sipâs mouthfeel is extremely thin, and lacks the sweet mouth coating stickiness that the nose lulled you into believing was coming. The limiting factor in the palate is the artificial taste of the molasses which comes across as more of an additive than what youâd typically find in a barrel finished whiskey - not exactly what Iâm looking for when I sip a whiskey.","A simple combination of oak, vanilla, and molasses. The vanilla quickly fades away followed by the oak a little while later. The molasses, however, lightly lingers for an incredibly long time. Itâs surprising how long the finish lasts considering this is only an 80 proof whiskey. What the palate lacks, the finish helps end on a higher note.","Like Basil Haydenâs Dark Rye, which Beam Suntory added port directly to the blend, the same is found here, but with rum instead. Some will cry foul, however a traditional rye is not the goal here. Rarely do you see distilleries going this route outside of Beam Suntory. Additionally, it would be impossible to review this rye without talking about how it compares to Angelâs Envy Rye, which is finished in ex-rum barrels. Angelâs Envy Rye can be quite polarizing. More often than not youâll find whiskey purists not impressed, while others enjoy seeing how far barrel finishes can be pushed. Iâm in the latter camp as Iâm always interested to see what barrel finishing can do to a whiskey and Iâm a big fan of the resulting flavor profile of Angelâs Envy Rye. To me, Angelâs Envy Rye is the closest thing that youâll find that could be considered a dessert whiskey (if such a category existed).So it comes down to how well these two ryes incorporate rum to create unique final products. Iâll come right out and say that Angelâs Envyâs use of rum barrel aging for their rye produces a more distinguishable, well-rounded, and unique product versus adding rum directly to the blend. Basil Haydenâs Caribbean Rye has the potential to hold its own if it wasnât for the unnaturalness of its palate. What it does do though, is bring a blend of rye and rum that, despite its flaws, many will find appealing due to its sweet and unique palate.","Unlike Angelâs Envy Rye which usually retails around $80 - $90, Basil Haydenâs Caribbean Rye feels like a good value at only $45. While you may not get the full depth that Angelâs Envy Rye offers, you get a slightly lesser product that still delivers a sweet rum influenced flavor profile for those who enjoy this type of marriage of flavors. Basil Haydenâs Caribbean Ryeâs 80 proof sippability and low price make this an ideal alternative to those who are looking for something different, but donât want to break the bank.",,Basil Haydenâs Caribbean Reserve Rye
31, Bourbon,35 Maple Street Spirits,Sourced (Rumored to be from Dickel),92,"6 Years (Note that while all future releases will follow the 6 year age statement, 35 Maple Street Spirits has stated that this first batch averages more around 7.5 years)", $55 (2017),"The nose has a very earthy scent to it with notes of leather, barley, chestnut and grass. It smells on the young side with little evidence that it was aged for six years in a barrel.","Much like the nose, the palate has an earthy base to it. The palate has some hints of cinnamon, however itâs liquorice that stands out the most. Some rye spice rounds out the palate. Overall the bourbon has a generally thin mouthfeel. It also has a very noticeable whitedog taste to it. For a bourbon that has an age statement of six years and that also contains some amount of seven and a half year old bourbon, it certainly doesnât taste like it.","As is the overall norm with this bourbon, earthy notes of pine and grass with liquorice dominate. These notes stay with you for the entirety of the semi-dry, medium length finish.","This is definitely an interesting bourbon. It didnât have a flavor profile that immediately made me love it, but it had enough curious elements that piqued my interest. Its flavor profile is definitely different than most bourbons, which probably doesnât make this a great bourbon if youâre new to the spirit. For a seasoned bourbon drinker, Bib & Tucker is going to be a âsorta like itâ or âhate it a lotâ bourbon. I donât see it as a bourbon people are going to fall head over heals for. The flavor profile just isnât at that level. But because of its very unique flavor, some people might be intrigued, while others are going to downright hate it.","At a price of $55 and a flavor profile that can be very polarizing, itâs a pretty costly gamble youâre taking buying this bourbon on the off-chance youâll like it. The flavor alone will keep this bourbon from being an everyday bourbon, so what youâre hoping to get from this, is something to break out from time to time to mix things up. If this is the case and Bib & Tucker becomes known as a special occasion bourbon, then maybe $55 will become an acceptable price for it.A premium priced bourbon should also have a bottle that conveys a similar message of âpremium.â It makes marketing sense that a unique bourbon needs an equally unique bottle (e.g. Blanton's, E.H. Taylor). Seeing Bib & Tuckerâs expertly designed bottle on the shelf screams âbuy me.â Seeing the price screams âIâm special.â Together they scream brilliant marketing. After all is said and done, and you take the bourbon at face value, Bib & Tucker simply isnât a $55 bourbon. Itâs an average bourbon in a fancy bottle.",October 2014,Bib & Tucker Bourbon
32, Straight Bourbon,Big Bottom,Midwest Grain Products Ingredients (MGPI),111,6 Years, $40 (2016),"Light traces of cinnamon and raisin. An alcohol burn is definitely present, but not overpowering.","Dried cherries fill your mouth instantly and then the palate mellows out into a mixture of peppery citrus and orange peels. Big Bottom presented me with a really interesting taste. I canât recall ever tasting anything quite like this. It fills your mouth with a slight burn up front, but at 111 proof, the warmth is expected and appreciated. The palate stays with you for a while, allowing you to really enjoy the taste of this bourbon. For such a high proof, itâs very drinkable without adding any water. That being said, after adding a few drops of water, the nose didnât change. But, with the water, the palate morphs into a nice spicy bourbon with stronger hints of pepper & citrus. Unfortunately, that delicious dried cherry taste vanished. Iâd recommend trying it straight before diluting it to taste so that you can experience that unique dried cherry flavor.","The finish on this bourbon is long and mellow. The fruit and citrus of the palate adds a very slight new wood taste in the finish, with something else lingering in the background.  Each time I took a sip, I got a consistent palate, but I kept trying to chase that lingering background taste for those additional slight flavors.Adding a few drops of water cleared the finish right up. The bourbon retained that new wood flavor, but a distinct and very mellow nut flavor came into play. It was subtle, more along the lines of plain walnuts mixed with a few almonds, but definitely present.","While they may not make their own bourbon, Big Bottom has done a fantastic job of bottling this bourbon just at the right time. You get a really interesting bourbon that makes you ponder whatâs going on with every sip.I do wish Big Bottom would provide more information on this product, as Iâm really interested to know how long this was aged in Indiana versus in their own aging warehouse in Oregon.  I'd also like to know what effect the weather of the Pacific Northwest had on the aging process.","For $40 this is a great deal. Sure Big Bottom isnât distilling their own bourbon, but they pulled this barrel at just the right time to bottle. Having discovered this bourbon for the first time in Portland, Iâm glad that I took a chance on this little gem. Still in very limited distribution throughout the US, I would highly recommend picking up a bottle if you can find one.",October 2013 / Ongoing,Big Bottom Single Barrel
33, Straight Bourbon,CVI Brands,Unconfirmed,95,NAS (Rumored 8 years), $45 (2014),"And then,  you taste it. The sweet nose completely disappears, and a very dry corn flavor takes over. Itâs quite shocking how different the nose and palate are from each other. It was something I wasnât expecting, and thatâs not necessarily a good thing in this case. Some rye spice develops on the mid to heavy back end.","The 95 proof makes Black Maple Hill an easy bourbon to sip. Very little heat allows the bourbon to make its mark without the burn. The flavor is not complex like a Pappy, making that common comparison between the two seem unfair. There arenât a lot of fireworks with this one. The oak and rye dominate. The finish gets to the point quickly and doesnât linger too long. Surprisingly, traces of alcohol flavor become more prominent as air mixes with the bourbon and overshadow much of what this bourbon had going for it.","This is easily one of the âhotâ bourbon finds of the last few years. Much of this started in the early 2000âs as the Lawrenceburg Black Maple Hill were bottled by ""Pappy"" Van Winkle. The older, age-stamped Black Maple Hill bourbon and ryes have become legendary even in that short amount of time. That hype has spilled over to the non-Van Winkle producing NAS orange label bottles of Black Maple Hill making them even hard to find. The question is, âis the orange label deserving of hype?â What we have is a rumored 8 year bourbon from a non-distiller producer whoâs barrel origin is not disclosed. We donât even know the quantity of CVI Brandâs output, so one bottle could be different from the next as they source from different producers as one âbatchâ runs out. Black Maple Hill is a straight-up bourbon that has itâs own specific flavor like any good brand has., but is it special? Not really.","If you remove the hype and take Black Maple Hill for what it is, it has a hard time standing up to other $40 bourbons. It certainly has an interesting flavor that separates itself from other bourbons in its price range, but here is a case where interesting doesnât always mean better. Itâs an OK bourbon thatâs priced a little on the high side. Donât get caught up in the hype, Black Maple Hill isnât worth the inflated prices people are selling it for on the after-market.","The first few times I had Black Maple Hill I flat-out hated it. It was in my top five of most hated bourbons. As I sipped it again for this review, Iâm found more things to like about it. It has an extremely pleasant nose but the palate and finish just canât match the bar the nose sets. Black Maple Hill is interesting, but the stark contrast from the sweet nose to the dry palate, to a developing alcohol flavor despite its low proof, make Black Maple Hill a pass in my book.",2013,Black Maple Hill
34, Straight Bourbon,Diageo,Combination of bourbon distilled by the Stitzel-Weller Distilling Company and other straight bourbons,91,NAS, $50 (2018),"The nose is light and airy and starts with aromas of peaches, honey, hay, and light oak. These scents are encapsulated within a dose of ethanol, which I wasnât expecting to be so prominent for a 91 proof bourbon.","The peaches from the nose carry over and are joined with white pepper, vanilla, oak, and a little grain spice. Itâs light and enjoyable with a nice balance of sweet and a dash of spice. The palate makes this really easy to sip on.","The finish starts with a spurt of light heat up front that mellows into sweeter notes. The fruit flavor and vanilla carry through and mingle with light oak. Theyâre further joined by a hint of aged leather at the end. These fade leaving just the oak to man the party, which lingers for longer than expected.","Solera aging is a rarity in the bourbon world. Few distilleries actually use this method due to the intensive labor involved in producing the end product. Additionally, the fact that Blade and Bow utilizes original Stitzel-Weller distillate in their solera process makes this all the more unique.It should be pointed out however, that while Stitzel-Weller distillate is used in the method, consumers actually have no idea how much ends up in each bottle. In all likelihood, itâs a very miniscule amount. While not a false statement, it feels like more of a marketing ploy than anything. The same can be said about distilling and aging in the Stitzel-Weller Distillery. Yes itâs iconic, but the name alone isnât what made the older stocks of Stitzel-Weller bourbon so special. It was the skill of the distillers and the ingredients at the time that made the bourbon what it was.","Blade and Bow seems to have all the right ingredients to charge a high price, the Stitzel-Weller name, the Stitzel-Weller location, and the Stitzel-Weller stock, along with a solera aging method. So few distilleries use the solera method to produce bourbon that Diageo is the only large producer utilizing this method. While they may be the largest, that doesnât mean that their arenât others utilizing this method. In fact one company weâd reviewed is Hillrock Estate Distillery and their Hillrock Estate Solera Aged Bourbon which retails for $90. In comparison Blade and Bowâs price tag is $50. On paper it feels like a deal and thatâs not even factoring in the other aforementioned traits. Keep in mind though that Hillrockâs higher price tag also delivers a bourbon with a more developed flavor profile too.However thereâs the story of Blade and Bow, and then thereâs the reality. Itâs a great everyday sipping bourbon, and also forms a great base for a cocktail, you can also find a lot of bourbons out there that do the same for less. In the end I canât help but feel youâre paying for the process and the name, versus the actual bourbon in the bottle. If youâre looking for an everyday sipping bourbon, there are a lot of great bourbons out there that will fill this need too.",April 2018,Blade & Bow Bourbon
35, Straight Bourbon,Diageo,Undisclosed,92,22 Years, $250 (2018),"The age is apparent from the moment I bring the glass to my nose. Aged oak, clove, cinnamon, and leather are present. Digging in deeper hints of orange cake, baking spices, and nutmeg appear. The scents all blend together quite nicely and provide a complex experience that begs for additional nosings.","Sweet on the tongue, the palate starts off with a dose of orange Jello, brown sugar, caramel, and a hint of vanilla. Beneath the sweeter flavor notes are subtle hints of the higher age, predominantly leather and a dash of white pepper. The mouthfeel is thin for such an old bourbon. The palate isnât bad per say, it just surprises you with a more youthful sip than expected, especially considering the way the nose tees up this bourbon.","The time spent in the barrel shines through in the finish. Oak, leather, a hint of tobacco, and cigar box intertwine right from the start. That said, none of the flavors are overpowering or overdone which is pleasantly surprising to see for a bourbon this old. What is somewhat disappointing though is the finish lingers for only a short while with just the oak and cigar box remaining.","From a flavor prospective, Blade and Bow 22 Year is nothing like its younger sibling which shares its name. While the standard no age statement (NAS) Blade and Bow is light and youthful with more fruit notes coming through, Blade and Bow 22 Year delivers a deeper overall experience, which should be expected considering itâs been resting in the barrel for 22 years and is sourced from a different distillery.For such an old bourbon it delivers a surprisingly drinkable experience. The expected oak notes are present, however they donât overpower and instead only help to enhance the experience. While this was unexpected to find, the palate throws a hiccup into the experience. I canât remember another 20 year-plus bourbon that delivers an appropriate nose and finish with such a thin sweet tasting palate.","The price of Blade and Bow 22 Year continues to rise as the years go on. When it was first released in 2015 the price was $150. Just three years later itâs nearly doubled to $250. In todayâs booming marketplace, a 22 year old bourbon selling for $250 should seem like a reasonable price. Other age stated bourbons continue to climb in price and very few expressions are 20 years or older on the market. However very few doesnât mean none at all.Barterhouse is a great example of a 20 year age stated bourbon from an undisclosed distillery, at almost the same proof, that sells for under $100. While not a true apples to apples comparison, itâs pretty darn close. In my opinion it doesnât have as fulfilling of a nose that Blade and Bow 22 Year delivers, however overall, Barterhouse delivers an almost equally good drinking experience for half the cost. It makes sense that Diageo would want to increase the price as their supply dwindles. While Blade and Bow 22 Year delivers a good drinking experience, that doesnât mean it gets a pass on the price. Yes itâs a very limited release with a 22 year age statement that some folks will buy no matter the price, but for those looking to drink this, there are better options on the market for less.",April 2018,Blade and Bow 22 Year
36, Straight Bourbon,"Sazerac Conapny Inc., Blanton's Distilling Company",Buffalo Trace,103,NAS, $85 (2016),"In a word, delicious. Raisins, dried fruit, citrus, and fresh hay shine through. This higher proof version of Blantonâs contains a slight increase in the noticeable alcohol scent on the nose versus the Original Single Barrel Blantonâs, while still offering a delicious refined smelling bourbon. Itâs amazing how much of a difference an increase in 10 proof points makes in rounding out a fuller bodied nose.","The palate on the Gold Edition offers a great mouthfeel and a subtle flavor profile.  Drier than I expected based on my experience with the other bottles in the Blantonâs line up, itâs marked with hints of vanilla, honey, toffee, tobacco, dried fruit, and pepper. The extra proof is more noticeable in the Gold Edition specifically with its pepper profile, which starts as a subtle spicy burn on the back end of the palate and roars up in the finish.","A lingering spice defines this bold finish. A pleasant slow burn engulfs your mouth and builds up heat as it slowly travels down your throat with each sip. Within that burn you have flavors of subtle rye, charred aged wood, leather, and honey. A dry heat stays in your mouth for a noticeable time and really prolongs the finish. I was able to âchewâ on this finish for several minutes and was really able to appreciate its flavor characteristics.","Blantonâs Gold Edition is only sold to select non-U.S. markets. At 103 proof, Blantonâs Gold Edition comes in 10 proof points higher than Blantonâs Original Single Barrel that you can buy in the U.S., which is sold at 93 proof. If you enjoy Blantonâs Original Single Barrel, this is one of two opportunities to try a higher proofed version from the distillery, the other being Blantonâs Straight from the Barrel. Itâs one of the few products on the market that allows you to do a side by side comparison of a brand at multiple proof points. I wish more products would do this as it allows consumers to buy the version thatâs best suited for their preferred proof range.The Gold Edition allows you to taste Blantonâs at a proof that offers full flavor without overpowering you from the increased alcohol. Itâs interesting to see what just a slight increase in proof can do to really bring out the flavor profile of the Blantonâs brand. Really a shame that they make consumers go out of their way to try it, because I find the bolder flavor profile to be more well rounded than what you currently see in other Buffalo Trace single barrel products.","At nearly double the price of Blantonâs Original Single Barrel, the value of Blantonâs Gold Edition certainly lies in the eye of the beholder. While I wouldnât let the price tag discourage someone from buying a bottle, I would have to think long and hard before buying another bottle. Donât get me wrong, I find this to be slightly better than the Blantonâs Original Single Barrel, however due to the fact that I can get almost two bottles of Blantonâs Original Single Barrel - which is fantastic in its own right - for the price of one bottle of the Gold Edition, it makes it a trickier situation.",Ongoing,Blanton's Gold Edition
37, Straight Bourbon,"Sazerac Conapny Inc., Blanton's Distilling Company",Buffalo Trace,93,NAS, $55 (2017),Fresh citrus wrapped in spicy caramel and vanilla. Very pleasant but subtle with little burn.,"A sweet blend of raisin, caramel, and orange coat the mouth with a soft but full amount of flavor. A little spice on the back end balances the initial sweetness. A floral hint is noticeable, but not so much so that it takes away from tasting like a true âbourbon.â","As the spice on the back end of the palate fades away, burnt sugars, caramel, and vanilla take over. This is just as pleasant as the rest of the sip and lasts a little longer than most bourbons.","Blantonâs claims to be the first and original single barrel bourbon dating back to 1984. Whether or not thatâs true really doesnât matter at this point as there are plenty of quality single barrel offerings: Colonel E.H.Taylor, Four Roses, and Eagle Rare, to name a few. There is, however, something notably different about Blantonâs flavor that makes it distinct; itâs just hard to put your finger on it.","It may just be my personal preference, but I think this is incredibly delicious bourbon and a steal at $45. There is a lot of personal preference built into that recommendation though, as it just doesnât stand up to the two tests on paper - age and accessibility. There is no age statement on the bottle, but Iâve read 8 years is the ballpark for most. That being said, Thomas Handy is 6 years aged and flies off the shelves at $70. Itâs also easily accessible. That could change, however, as demand continues to heat up. If this does become more difficult to get your hands on I have a feeling people will be scrambling to get a bottle. Entering into the $50 range also brings some steep competition: Russellâs Reserve Single Barrel, Knob Creek Single Barrel, Four Roses Single Barrel, Van Winkle Special Reserve (12 year Lot B), and so on. I think this is one you will just have to try for yourself. If you love it as I do, youâll find the price to be more than fair.",Ongoing,Blanton's Single Barrrel
38, Straight Bourbon,"Sazerac Conapny Inc., Blanton's Distilling Company",Buffalo Trace,80,NAS, $48 (2016),"The nose can best be summed up as really light. Light traces of grain, hay, new wood and citrus are present along with hints of dried fruit. While pleasant, itâs definitely weaker than the Original Single Barrel Blantonâs nose, which I normally find quite delicious and have a hard time pulling away from. Nothing really jumps out that makes me want to continue to nose this bourbon like I normally would with a glass of Original Blantonâs.","The first thing I notice when tasting this bourbon is a watered down slightly sweet palate. Traces of honey, citrus, vanilla, and a faint hint of pepper were noticeable. While pleasant it isnât very complex and the flavors seemed to disappear before I even finish swallowing a sip.","While relatively short on this edition of Blantonâs, the finish is much more present then the nose and palate. Traces of new wood are present, along with rye, a hint of leather, and what can best be described as fresh cut grass - the defining flavor that stayed with me until the finish dissipated.","This is a really interesting bourbon in terms of uniqueness. Itâs clearly aimed at individuals who donât like high proof bourbons or are just starting to drink bourbon. For all practical purposes, youâre getting a watered down version of the Original Blantonâs Single Barrel. One that is only sold overseas to boot.However just because itâs only sold outside of the US, doesnât automatically make it inherently special. Sure you may impress a few bourbon enthusiasts by buying a bottle that isnât readily available until they realize that they have access to a version of Blantonâs thatâs head and shoulders better than Blantonâs Special Reserve. When drinking this bourbon I kept thinking that the soul of Blantonâs seemed to be missing. Gone were the intense delicious flavors found in the Original Single Barrel Blantonâs, and instead I felt someone had slipped one to many ice cubes in my Blantonâs and watered it down just a tad too much.","While this may be a unique bourbon only in the sense that you canât normally buy it in the US, the price of admission just isnât worth it in my book. Coming in at almost $50, itâs selling at the same price as a bottle of Blantonâs Original Single Barrel. Seeing as this bourbon was slightly below average when it came to the nose, palate, and finish, itâs really hard to justify the price for the Special Reserve version.",Ongoing,Blanton's Special Reserve
39, Straight Bourbon,"Sazerac Conapny Inc., Blanton's Distilling Company",Buffalo Trace,130,NAS, $110 (2017),"Raisins, dried fruit, orange citrus zest, and lightly toasted oak all merge together in a perfect blend. I can best describe it as warming and inviting, like a toasty wood burning fire on a cold winterâs day. Itâs just a perfect blend of everything you love about the nose on Blantonâs, just enriched and greatly amplified. Taking a big breath in the alcohol is definitely upfront and noticeable, as should be expected for a 130 proof bourbon. While the alcohol isnât overpowering, it definitely makes itself present and takes away ever so slightly from the experience.","While the nose underplays the fact that this is 130 proof, the palate definitely brings you right back to reality. This is a big, bold, rich bourbon thatâs packing some heat. Ever so dry, the palate brings through a rich, heavy dose of oak along with vanilla, light honey, butterscotch, and plump juicy raisins. You really are contending with the heat though to pick out these flavors. Adding a few drops of water helps slightly reduce the heat and really pulls out the flavors in the palate.","The finish starts just like the palate, which in a word is HOT. The moment I finish taking my sip, my mouth instantly explodes into a ball of fire as the alcohol takes over. Ironically that burn is really just contained to my mouth and doesnât travel down my throat or into my stomach like some other barrel proof bourbons like George T. Stagg are known to do. The finish is definitely drier, however it carries with it a nice flavor profile of preserved peaches, light vanilla, raisins, and oak. Even adding a few drops of water does little to subdue this fiery beast. Itâs a shame because the heat overpowers the flavors just a little too much in this case to really appreciate all this has to offer.","Barrel proof bourbons are more and more common in todayâs marketplace, with many more new releases being barrel proof / cask strength than in years past. That being said, a single barrel, barrel proof bourbon is still the exception to the norm. Even rarer is a standard lower-proof single barrel being offered in addition to a barrel proof offering of the same brand. The only other company offering this combination is Four Roses with their standard single barrel and barrel proof private selection bottles and occasional limited releases.Blantonâs Straight from the Barrel (SFTB) flavor profile is a tasty enhanced bolder Blantonâs, though the heat from the proof greatly impacts the overall experience by taking away from the palate and more so the finish. Additionally, Iâm not blown away tasting anything so unique that you might find in a George T. Stagg or a William Larue Weller. That being said, itâs really interesting to see not only what Blantonâs tastes like at full strength, but also how great of a job Buffalo Trace does in taming this beast down to the standard Blantonâs Original Single Barrel thatâs lower cost and more readily accessible in the U.S.Blantonâs SFTB only being sold in select non-U.S. markets and select domestic duty free stores is a shame. This version of Blantonâs offers a unique chance to see what Blantonâs tastes like when itâs cranked up to full strength, and boy does it deliver on that promise. This bottle clocks in at 37 proof higher than the standard version of Blantonâs and even 27 proof higher than the very tasty Blantonâs Gold edition.","Since this is an international only bourbon, the price will be tied to foreign currency fluctuation for anyone looking to import or buy abroad. When I reviewed Blantonâs Gold, for example, it was selling at almost double the cost of two bottles of standard Blantonâs, whereas now itâs only one and a half times the amount. That being said, Blantonâs SFTB consistently sells for the same price one could snag two bottles of original Blantonâs for, with change left over. Not even taking into account the cost of acquiring through either travel or import fees, apples to apples it also sells for higher than the bottles in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection (BTAC) which this can best be compared to.While the price may be higher, it wins points on being much more available than the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection. Released throughout the year, you can usually find a bottle online in the foreign market if you look hard enough and are willing to pay import fees. Additionally, it comes back to being one of the few single barrel, barrel proof offerings on the market and one that delivers an experience that helps justify the higher price.",Ongoing,Blanton's Straight From the Barrel
40, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,130.8,"10 Years, 3 Months", $100 (2014),"Lots of alcohol upfront. Followed by toasted wood, light traces of nuts and coffee. While pleasant, I wasnât blown away by the initial nose on this.","This bourbon was a big cup of sweet for me. A strong blast of the sugars from the wood hits you the moment you take a sip. Caramel and vanilla pop right out of this bourbon, along with a light woody taste. In addition to the sugar and wood, I also tasted a trace of citrus along the line of orange rinds. The palate quickly morphs into a nice long finish. For bourbon this high in proof, itâs a really easy to sip neat.","The flavors found in the finish hit quickly and stay consistent throughout. Itâs comprised of a mellow nutty flavor along the lines of walnuts, with light traces of toasted marshmallow.","Barreled just before the death of Fred Noe II, the extra 4+ years in the aging warehouse treated this bourbon well. Much like the Booker's 10th anniversary release, Booker's 25th is a special one off release from the Beam Family. Once these bottles are gone, theyâre gone for goodâ¦until the next commemorative anniversary bottling comes along.","At $100 youâre getting a really great tasting bourbon. The normal bottling of Booker's retails for a little under $60 and is really great tasting bourbon as is. However this special bottling ups the game ever so slightly. Is it worth the extra $40 to buy a bottle? That one is debatable. If youâre a fan of Booker's normally, youâll definitely want to try to find any remaining bottles. If youâve never had Booker's or arenât a huge fan normally, stick to trying to find a glass of this one in your favorite bourbon bar.",February 2014,Booker's 25th Anniversary
41, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,128.5,"6 Years, 2 Months", $70 (2017),"On first whiff, I got a strong upfront alcohol burn, which is common for barrel proof bourbons. Behind it lingers the smell of oak, light floral notes, and a solid nutty scent. The smell alone tells you to sit down and buckle up!  This isnât a bourbon to be taken lightly.","Wow - is this a sweet tasting bourbonâ¦both literally and figuratively! For such a high proof, I was very surprised at how nice the mouthfeel was on this. You get a quick upfront hit of the sugars from the wood, along with hints of vanilla and raisin. Right after that initial taste, my mouth was instantly warmed, as I could feel the heat of the bourbon quickly encompassing every corner of my mouth. This then morphed into the taste of aged wood and light leather.","Booker's delivered a long light lingering finish. The flavor burst you get from the palate all but disappears and instead youâre left with a light vanilla and fresh new wood finish. I was surprised I wasnât blown away with a bold finish considering this bourbon had so much bite up front in the initial palate. Instead, I found myself going back for more and more sips just to capture some additional flavor.","While Booker's may have been the first mass produced barrel proof bourbon to hit the market, barrel proof bourbons are more common now than when Booker's was first introduced. Between many of the Buffalo Trace products, Heaven Hill releases, and a multitude of craft distillers, one can easily find a barrel proof bourbon to try. That being said, Booker's has been able to consistently deliver a quality product year after year. While preferences may vary by batch, you can count on a great barrel proof bourbon with every bottle.","While not necessarily inexpensive, Booker's does a nice job of delivering value to the consumer. You get barrel proof bourbon thatâs full of flavor and easy enough to drink at a high proof. Itâs slightly more than what you would pay for a Stagg Jr. or an Elijah Craig Barrel Proofbottle. However, you can find Booker's on the shelf any day of the week, versus having to camp out outside of a liquor store to find one of the aforementioned bottles.",Ongoing,Booker's Bourbon
42, Straight Rye,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,136.2,"13 Years, 1 Months, 12 Days", $300 (2016),"This is the definition of a deceptively high proof whiskey. Coming in at a 130+ proof you would expect a bold dose of ethanol, however thereâs only enough to let you know itâs high in proof without being overly hot. Instead youâre greeted with a classic rye smell of rye grain, white pepper, oak, and leather, along with a touch of caramel sweetness. This is as deep as it is rich, which provides a great nosing experience each time you bring the glass to your nose.","A big bold rye is delivered in the sip. Unlike the nose, the palate comes out swinging immediately from the start and lets you know that this is a rye thatâs not to be taken lightly. A great mouthfeel delivers rye spice, allspice, citrus peel oil, and cinnamon bark, along with a peppery heat that engulfs your mouth. The palate is surprisingly nuanced and full of flavor for such a high proof whiskey, and each sip delivers a great dose of flavor.","Spicy. Really spicy in a great way. A huge amount of heat billows up from my throat into my mouth as I swallow. Iâm greeted with a drier finish consisting of aged oak, leather, and cigar box undertones. A dry, chewy oak finish full of rye spice lingers for a really long time. This is everything you want out of a higher aged high proof rye.","Multiple factors make this truly a one of a kind rye from Beam. Aged almost 3 years longer than Bookerâs 25th Anniversary and almost double the time the standard Bookerâs spends in the barrel, this is one of the higher aged ryes that's been releases to the market. Beam doesnât disclose the mashbill, but Bookerâs Rye tastes different than the standard Beam rye mashbill which is 51% rye. It also doesnât taste like a 95% rye which you commonly find in the market from MGP. Instead it tastes somewhere in the middle. Finally you have its high proof point. While Bookerâs Bourbons are often in the low 120âs to low 130âs, fewer ryes exist and as a result it's more rare to see such a high proof rye.All those factors aside, you also have to take into account the history of this bottling. Even if Jim Beam has a few barrels laying around of this rye that is being extra aged, this is most likely the first and the last rye that was placed in the barrel by Booker Noe. It nicely symbolizes the transition between father and son with Booker placing this in the barrel and Fred determining when was the right time to dump it out. In a time when everyone is trying to come up with the most unique off-the-wall story about their product, Bookerâs Rye relies on the simple fact that it itâs a one-of-a-kind release that was created by a one-of-a-kind man. Thatâs pretty hard to beat in my book.","Three. Hundred. Dollars. While thatâs expensive for any American whiskey, it was unheard of for an American rye at the time, especially one that was only 13 years old. While it comes with a one-of-a-kind backstory and delivers a fantastic flavor profile, at first it was hard not to be gobsmacked by its price tag.When Jim Beam released the fantastic Bookerâs 25th Anniversary for $100 everyone was shocked. How could an extra aged Bookerâs be worth double the price of the standard release? While it seemed slow to build momentum, most people eventually realized it was a fantastic bourbon and prices quickly skyrocketed in the secondary market. Surely Beam took note of what was taking place and tried to course correct that with Booker's Rye.To me though, Jim Beam overshot the price they charged for this rye. While Bookerâs Rye is one of the better ryes released in recent years, itâs hard for me to justify a $300 price tag when there are so many other good ryes out there. Letâs be clear, Iâm not talking about other ryes that will deliver the same experience that Bookerâs Rye delivers, but instead these are ryes that are good in their own right. For the price of one bottle of Bookerâs rye I could literally buy every single bottle of rye on our best of list. While I canât blame a distillery capitalizing on a limited release, itâs hard to also justify the price tag that Beam ultimately chose for this. With that being said, high quality ryes like this donât come along every day, so for some the additional premium will be easier to justify in their book.",June 2016,Booker's Rye
43, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,A. Smith Bowman Distillery,90,NAS (Press materials state between 6-7 years), $33 (2017),"A welcoming aroma of brown sugar, sweet cinnamon, oak, and a twinge of floral potpourri. A quick swirl of the glass brings forth a bouquet of additional sweet notes of candy apple, peach, and custard. Itâs a pleasant nose with a fair amount of complexity that surprised me quite a bit.","Its oily and thick mouthfeel is immediately noticeable. Vanilla, toffee, roasted nuts, and toasted oak hit with medium intensity. Despite having sweeter flavors, the palate is quite dry overall, and keeps the sweet flavors in check. Itâs a little rough around the edges, but has a decent core.","Quite a bit of spiciness that makes it seem as if someone dropped a jalapeno in my glass. This isnât a hot finish, but a spicy one. Toasted oak, black pepper, and red pepper flakes dominate. Itâs not spicy to the point of clearing your sinuses, but more of a fiery blast with a long fallout. Itâs a bit more interesting than it is delicious, but overall, wow.","Starting with sweet and floral notes with the nose, oily and thick mouthfeel on the palate, and ending on a uniquely spicy finish, this is one heck of a ride. I just didnât expect this from a 90 proof, 6-7 year old $33 bourbon. The company was able to take a sourced distillate and create a product thatâs all their own. This is not an easy task, and many non-distiller producers try and fail to do it all the time. For all of A. Smith Bowmanâs marketing speak of âtriple distillation,â âcopper still,â âaged in Virginia rickhouses,â these aspects seem to have had an actual impact on the final product.","This is a bourbon where its uniqueness really plays into its value. Many bourbons try and offer something unique in the $30 price range, but in reality, this price range is often a catch-all for average barrels. When a company is producing thousands of barrels and batching them in huge numbers, more times than not, the end result is one that lacks a good deal of character. That is certainly not an issue here. There's little doubt of Bowman Brothers Small Batchâs wealth of character and overall quality for its price. In the end though, a good deal of its additional value will lean on how heavily someone enjoys its unique traits.",Ongoing,Bowman Brothers Small Batch

Itâs a nice balance. It looks thin in the glass, however the flavor is fuller than would be expected considering the proof.","Medium length with just the right amount of burn. The flavors really taper off nicely and it leaves a wonderful aftertaste. It feels more like a 90+ proof sip than 86, which is a good thing in this case.","When it comes down to the sip, nothing screams unique with this bourbon. Itâs no-gimmick, traditional, yet well rounded flavor is something youâd have difficulty picking out in a blind taste test. Their story is somewhat compelling, as the distillery claims to use mineral-rich snowmelt as itâs not-so-secret secret ingredient. And then thereâs its young 2-3 year age which youâd never guess based on taste alone. Ultimately this is a premium quality, traditional *yet very good* tasting bourbon that can be produced more quickly than youâd expect.","Craft distillery bourbons span a wide range of quality, from amazingly unique gems down to corny, grassy, not-aged-quite-enough garbage. Some are like nothing youâve ever tasted, while others fall short of anything youâd want to drink again. Unfortunately the quality is rarely reflected in price, as these smaller distilleries typically have to sell at a premium to make their nut. Often times weâre paying for the experience and story behind the bottle as much as the spirit inside it. $50 for a craft-distilled 750ml bottle is acceptable, regardless of the quality or age of the juice within the bottle. Breckenridge manages to pull of something miraculous giving us a smooth, well-rounded, easy sipper thatâs worth the $43 they sell it for. It beats the pants off Rhetoric, which is more than double the price.",Ongoing,Breckenridge Bourbon

The palate might be too sweet for some, but probably very enjoyable for most. Light amounts of oak and rye spice round out the palate.",A moderate length finish with oak at the forefront. The finish really opens up and develops and ultimately ends by filling your nostrils.  Itâs a very interesting and full flavored finish for a 90 proof bourbon.,"Buffalo Trace Bourbon doesnât have a flavor profile that screams unique, and thatâs probably by design. Buffalo Trace Distillery doesnât disclose the exact mashbill for their flagship brand, but we do know itâs low on rye (10% or less) and that George T. Stagg, Eagle Rare, and E.H. Taylor Small Batch are made from the same recipe. What makes Buffalo Trace Bourbon unique is that for a lower priced bourbon it doesnât taste âcheap.â Additionally, itâs surprisingly robust for a 90 proof bourbon. Itâs not trying to be the most unique bourbon at the party, just one that everyone gets along with at the party.","As with any low priced bourbon, there are different types of drinkers to speak value to. For people using it as a mixing bourbon, its full flavor mixes well without losing many of the bourbon's characteristics, and itâs probably priced right around the max of what they want to spend. As a sipper, no matter what experience you may have drinking whiskey straight, anyone can enjoy drinking this one.

46, Whiskey,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,90,"7 Years, 1 Month", $46 (375ml) (2017),"A somewhat peculiar mix of aromas that are light and airy, but still have a commanding sense about them. Herbal tones, butterscotch, and oak mingle with gentle notes of grain and rice. This mix produces a rather enjoyable aroma that is quite unique coming from a whiskey.","An earthy mix that weighs heavily on grain notes. There are moments when butterscotch and vanilla pop, but they quickly fade. Pine, wheat, maltiness, herbal tea, and apricot are also present, but the majority of these flavors are hard to discern as they are mostly muddled together.","The whiskey ends on a bit of an odd note. Thereâs a predominant aftertaste that is reminiscent of wood tannins, but it doesn't come off like it usually does. It most likely has to do with the number of grains involved here. There is also a small fiery blast in the finish that quickly dissipates. Itâs more interesting than bad, more captivating than good.","This is the second release from Buffalo Trace in two months sporting an above-average number of grains in the mashbill. In my E.H. Taylor Four Grain review, I spoke of a lack of a benchmark when reviewing a product like this. With two such releases so close together, some interesting comparisons can be made between them. Where E.H. Taylor Four Grain was sweeter and its intensity more pitch-perfect, Organic Six Grain is a little more wild in nature. Its six grain mashbill makes for a more challenging understanding of its flavor complexity. It's actually a bit hard to pull out many specific flavors due to the whirlwind of those that are present. The whiskey is by no means offensive, just excessively unique. Scotch drinkers may be used to a wildly different tasting whiskey like this, but in the bourbon world, Organic Six Grain will probably come off as bizarre.","Buffalo Traceâs Experimental Collection has never been highly sought after by the masses. With small release numbers, 375ml bottles, limited marketing, and characteristics that appear to some as gimmicks, they arenât on consumers' radar like some of the the companyâs other releases. There must be something about experiential releases that makes consumers pause, since other companies that release similar products in the form of âmaster collectionsâ or âexperimental cask finishesâ receive similar lukewarm responses.That has slowly been changing. Buffalo Trace has also been doing a better job promoting their Warehouse X aging warehouse and their Experimental Collection releases. With many recent bourbon releases lacking a spark of uniqueness, it seems more eyes are beginning to turn to these âexperimentalâ releases. The problem with âexperimentalâ is that it can also mean taking a big, fat chance. There's little in the way of a guarantee with any release, even less so with a release like this.Organic Six Grain isnât too far off from E.H. Taylor Four Grain, yet it was released as part of the Experimental Collection and not as part of one of Buffalo Traceâs major brands. E.H. Four Grain was unique tasting, but still within the bourbon flavor wheelhouse to warrant a release as part of the Taylor brand at a respectable $70 asking price. Organic Six Grain at $46 for a 375ml bottle is asking a lot on paper, but there is something about half bottles that makes it a little easier to swallow. If this was sold in 750ml bottles at $92, it would be easy to overlook this release. Unique whiskeys benefit greatly when packaged in half size bottles. This might be something youâll want to visit from time to time and is actually packaged and priced accordingly.",May 2017,Buffalo Trace Organic Six Grain Whiskey
47, Straight Bourbon,Diageo,Undisclosed Source,91.2,10 Year, $45 (2017),"Sweet caramel and vanilla notes are beautifully offset by toasted oak and spice. A noticeable deeper layer of citrus, cherry, butterscotch, and pepper adds a small, but beneficial layer of depth. A healthy inhale of the aromas is even more satisfying as it brings out an extra layer of intensity. While it would be going too far to call the scents amazing, they definitely leave a positive impression and are better than some bourbons twice its price.","Spice and wood jump strongly out of the gate, overlapping notes of cherry, vanilla, and leather. There is an enjoyable, yet relatively shallow amount of depth in the palate thatâs over with far too quickly. A gentle sipper with a spicy bite.","There is a fleeting intensity of flavors here. Thereâs an immediate rush of dark fruit and rye spice that quickly peters out leaving a dry, flat, and overall one-dimensional aftertaste. Wood takes over and dominates the long finish, overstaying its welcome and lasting longer than it should.","As with the no age statement (NAS) orange label Bulleit, Bulleit 10 Year has a very spicy and wood-forward palate, but packs a little more of a pop. Surprisingly, the extra age in the barrel does little to mellow the 10 Yearâs spice and itâs very hard to detect if it got any sweeter. The extra aging does bring some much needed depth to its palate that the NAS version lacks. This is important, since Bulleit 10 Year is priced in the $40 range and will be more likely consumed as a sipping bourbon vs used as more as a mixer like the NAS version. Beyond its spicy character and great nose, there is little here to call overly unique to distinguish itself from the NAS bottle.","Comparing Bulleit 10 Year to other $40-$50 bourbons, its wood and spice traits can be overbearing and wonât be for everyone. Even knowing this is sourced from Four Roses, itâs still difficult to recommend this over the slightly less expensive Four Roses Single Barrel; which is a superior product in every way. The 10 Yearâs immediate burst of flavor on its palate is quite enjoyable, but it can very easily act as a diversion from the bottleâs weaknesses. It simply doesnât have the depth and flavor range as many of the bourbons on our Best $40-$50 Bourbons list. Again, comparing it to the Bulleit NAS bourbon, it certainly has more depth, but only marginally so. It even lacks that versionâs creamy mouthfeel, which as a sipping bourbon, would have greatly benefited from.

48, Straight Rye,Diageo,MGP Ingredients,92,12 Years, $50,"Punchy out of the glass, with heavy baking spices, strawberry cream, mild dill, cocoa powder, and slight hints of grass. It is much more potent than I expected and the depth of the aroma is surprising. Itâs an interesting blend of scents that work well together.","A very grounded array of flavors thatâs heavy on oak, brown sugar, spice, and molasses. Some floral, semi-sweet chocolate, and graham cracker notes are also present, but have minor influence on the overall flavor profile.","This is where the whiskeyâs age shows most, as oak dominates resulting in a finish that flirts with a bitter and tannic aftertaste. This is a bit disappointing as the finish is relatively simple and suggests the age did more to harm the whiskey than to enhance it.","The most obvious standout trait of this release is its 12 year age statement. Itâs incredibly rare for a rye to even boast an age statement, let alone one with an impressive 12 years behind it. With so many brands sourcing their rye from MGP, youâd think more would have them. This might be due to MGPâs shortage of aged rye stock. Although whatâs more interesting is that Bulleit is the brand that actually has it, which might be the result of the companyâs long standing relationship with MGP, and why other brands have looked to Tennessee distilleries for aged rye stock. Of course an age statement means nothing if it does little to change, enhance, or transform the baseline whiskey it comes from. The standard Bulleit Rye is a no-frills rye, for better or for worse. Itâs unoffensive, not all that memorable, but quite drinkable and extremely crushable (if thatâs your thing). Comparing the two, the standard Bulleit Ryeâs flavor profile resides on a higher octave, with lighter, brighter, and sweeter flavors. In contrast, the 12 Year is on a lower octave with deeper flavors, more oak, and additional weight to its mouthfeel. The 12 Year isnât light-years ahead of the standard version, but it will most likely appeal to bourbon enthusiasts with its richer flavor profile that is more conducive to drinking neat. ","Age stated rye whiskeys are quite elusive in todayâs whiskey market. Of the few that sport them, they are often reserved for limited releases or single barrels, and command a premium price. Itâs quite refreshing to see Diageo release this 12 year old rye at a price you probably would have expected a few years ago, let alone in 2019. The company could have easily released this as an annual limited release and asked double for it. Perhaps this is a sign of whiskey companies starting to pull back from demanding top dollar for every new release despite whether the product warrants it or not. Quite frankly, this would have sat on the shelves at $100, but at $50 and with wide availability (after its full rollout), this should result in decent sales. Not everyone will love its 92 proof, but Diageo probably wanted to hit this price point and achieve maximum drinkability for all. Iâm sure many would have loved to see this over 100 proof, but at 92, many will find this a satisfying pour and a great value for its age.",,Bulleit 95 Rye 12 Year
49, Straight Bourbon,Diageo,Undisclosed Source,90,NAS, $30 (2017),"Equal amounts of vanilla, caramel, and orange zest overlay more tamer notes of smoke, cherry, and oak. Thereâs a good amount of richness to the aromas, however theyâre light on depth. An enjoyable spiciness bounces off the sweeter notes, but overall the nose is quite frank; straightforward with little fuss.","A sweet caramel opening quickly transforms into a peppery oak bomb. Despite its light body it still manages to have a creamy mouthfeel and the palate surprisingly packs a burst of flavor. Unfortunately, this flavor pop is one-dimensional and not very complex, simply consisting of pepper and oak. Minor notes of cinnamon and ginger are also present, but they struggle to shine over the bourbon's spiciness.","The bourbonâs hardfisted spiciness continues until the very end. Spice, pepper, and oak dominate, with notes of butterscotch, mint, and cherry wavering in and out. There is an enjoyable amount of smoothness and creaminess on the finish that keeps the peppery spice from being too hard to drink. This is again surface-level complexity on display, but just enough overall quality to make the bourbon enjoyable.","Quickly over the past 10 years, Bulleit has made a big name for itself. The brand has given Makerâs Mark and Jim Beam a run for their money, appearing on, what feels, just as many bar shelves in the U.S. as those major brands. Being owned by Diageo doesnât quite make Bulleitâs rise a David versus Goliath story, but doing it so quickly and effectively is quite a feat. This is in large part due to Diageoâs marketing muscle, which also extends to Bulleitâs now-iconic and much-loved bottle design. Of course another large part has to do with whatâs inside the bottle.It is now known that Four Roses had been supplying Diageo with a special blend for their brand for years. Despite consumers not officially knowing for years that the bourbon was sourced from Four Roses, it was still their quality stock, which probably had a lot to do why it resonated with people and aided with Bulleitâs quick rise in popularity. With that arrangement now said to be ending (or ended), and Diageo sourcing from a new producer while Bulleit gets their own distillery up and running (due to open in late 2016), itâs getting harder to know just what Bulleit actually is.As with the case with any non-distiller-producer (NDP), maintaining a consistent flavor profile must be an endless challenge and one Bulleit probably hasnât had to contend with in a long time. As a result of sourcing, Bulleit has an overall respectable level of quality stemming from the deal they made with Four Roses years ago, but the bourbonâs lack of complexity and memorable characteristics beyond its spiciness may have a lot to do with lack of direct control of their own product.","Bulleit is foremost marketed as a mixing bourbon. As such, its high-rye content results in ample amounts of pepper and spice, which helps the bourbon stand up no matter what itâs mixed with. This boldness and overall quality helps put Bulleit in the higher echelon of mixing bourbons. Its $30+ price further re-enforces this, as itâs higher than Makerâs Mark and Jim Beam, making its perception of value appears greater. Much like the sweeping price fluctuations consumers see with major sellers like Makerâs Mark and Jim Beam, Bulleit is also privy to the same price variations and often found below $30 in some markets.From a sipping bourbon standpoint, Bulleit also holds up well. Itâs easy to drink, and its spicy pop makes it standout from most bourbons. Itâs not infinitely better than other $30 bourbons, in fact itâs very comparable to many in that range. Itâs more up to a personâs personal flavor preference since nothing about this bourbon screams amazing. It wants to be the best at both worlds, and while it doesnât quite achieve it, itâs a respectable showing.",Ongoing,Bulleit Bourbon

It's a straightforward palate that merely intensifies what you may love or hate about the standard Bulleit Bourbon. Itâs once again very peppery and oaky, but surprisingly not as overbearing as what I thought an additional 29 proof points might do to the standard version. Working the bourbon around in your mouth pulls out some minor fruit notes that would have otherwise remained unknown. Itâs not an earth shattering discovery, but an enjoyable bright spot in an otherwise ho-hum experience.","Straightforward and consistent: starts hot, develops some creaminess, and finishes dry. The finish lacks much flavor besides plentiful notes of oak and spice, which is to be expected coming from a barrel strength version of the standard Bulleit Bourbon. The extra proof points have done little to pull out additional flavors from the standard version and instead simply make it hotter and amplify the spicier notes. Itâs marginally enjoyable but still not all that interesting.","Any time a popular brand decides to release a barrel strength version of their standard product, people take extra notice. The common assumption that barrel proof means better, simply because a higher alcohol concentration should bring enhanced flavors, isnât always as guaranteed as people may think. Companies get a lot of flak when they âwater downâ their product for a sub-100 proof release, but this might be a time where that water helps tame an otherwise overpowering flavor agent that is hard to taste past. The problem is the standard Bulleit Bourbon isnât all that unique or complex to begin with. Itâs a long shot to expect adding proof points is going to drastically enhance the standard Bulleit, which as the Barrel Strength demonstrates, does not.","The standard Bulleit Bourbon is priced in the $30 range and the 10 Year in the $40 range, so it makes sense for the Barrel Strength version to be priced in the $50 range. With the majority of barrel strength bourbons also priced in this range, itâs logical for Bulleit to follow suit. Except in this case, Bulleit Barrel Strength doesnât compare flavorwise to other barrel strength bourbons and has a harder time offering the same value.For many Bulleit superfans, having access to a higher proof Bulleit is priceless and comparisons to other brands are meaningless. But for someone looking for a rich and satisfying barrel strength bourbon, there are better options in the same price range. Comparing this to the similarly priced and easily obtainable Bookerâs, itâs a no-contest. Bookerâs beats it in every category. The same holds true for other slightly more expensive and harder to find barrel strength bourbons, such as Elijah Craig Barrel Proof and Four Roses private selections. Bulleit Bourbon Barrel Strength is a good example that not all barrel strength bourbons are created equal.",April 2016 in Kentucky,Bulleit Bourbon Barrel Strength
51, Bourbon,Cedar Ridge Vineyards,Cedar Ridge Distillery,100*,NAS, $40,"Lots of corn, grain, and new oak. Thereâs a tingling of ethanol that makes its presence known, but not enough to be to unpleasant. While this is aged for a minimum of four years, it comes off as a whiskey that hasnât spent a ton of time in the barrel due to the lack of depth displayed in its weak nose.","Corn, light vanilla, fruit jam, a hint of pear, and oak. The palate is more interesting than the nose, however all of the flavors present are very light and you really have to hunt them out. The ethanol that was clearly present in the nose isnât present, and this bourbon ends up drinking lower than the 100 proof it clocks in at.","White pepper, light fruits, vanilla, and fresh wood are all present at the start of the finish. These notes then fade away to just the white pepper and fresh wood, which linger for a short period. Itâs simple, short, and leaves an unmemorable impression.","As we pointed out in our 2016 The Year in Bourbon article, more and more bourbons from upstart distillers arrive on the market every year. Cedar Ridgeâs whiskeys have the distinction of being produced in Iowa, using Iowa raised corn, and from the first licensed distillery in the state since Prohibition. However since it first opened, there are now eight other whiskey distilleries that operate in the state.Whatâs unique about this specific bourbon is that it was bottled 20 proof points higher than the standard 80 proof version you can find in stores. While I always prefer to taste bourbons around 95-115 proof range - since I find more flavor usually shines through - this version of Cedar Ridge is lacking in distinguishing flavor characteristics that I was expecting to find. It really makes me wonder why Cedar Ridge chose to settle on 80 proof for their wide release.","As is often the case when reviewing a bourbon from a new distillery, youâre paying a premium as the distillery tries to establish itself. I pointed this out in my review of 2Bar Bourbon from Seattle and OYOfrom Columbus, and the same can be said for this bourbon. At $40, this is priced slightly less than the $50 price tag you see from many other young distilleries. That said, that doesnât mean it represents a good value for the bourbon found inside the bottle. For example, the Big Bottom Single Barrel I reviewed was also priced at $40 and offers a much deeper and tastier drinking experience. In this case, $40 is a lot to pay for a bourbon that tastes much younger than it really is.",Ongoing,Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon Whiskey
52, Straight Bourbon,Chicken Cock Whiskey,"MGP Ingredients, Inc.",90,8 Years, $100,"The aroma is basic, or common to say the least. Vanilla, caramel, a bit of oak, and a trace of ethanol comprise the nose. Itâs a pleasant, inviting array of scents, but not at all distinguishing.","Light on entry, the bourbon allows you to hold it in your mouth for quite some time without experiencing an overwhelming burn. As evidenced by the nose, vanilla, oak, and caramel are present and mingle nicely together. While the mouthfeel does little to enhance the experience, it doesnât detract from it either, delivering the flavors in a straightforward way. Itâs an enjoyable flavor combination thatâs impeccably balanced, albeit a little underwhelming.","Peppery spice kicks in, giving way to charred oak and intensely sweet caramel. It lingers for a while, with the spice coming back into play again after the caramel and charred oak taper off. Thereâs a trace of seasoned oak at the end, which enhances the experience as it draws to a close. Overall the finish is really well done, and easily the highlight of the sip.","With age statements dropping, itâs nice to see a new release with an age statement. That said, itâs a limited release, and age statements still remain fairly common in that realm. The bourbonâs other traits - mashbill, source, and flavor profile, arenât particularly unusual in any way. Fortunately itâs released as a single barrel, so there will be some variation by barrel and hopefully some with flavor profiles that are a little more unique tasting than others.While it has no impact on the whiskey itself, the history of the Chicken Cock brand is intriguing. The bottle design is also reminiscent of the old prescription whiskey bottle design, and itâs easily one of the best looking bottles Iâve ever seen. But these characteristics are only surface deep, and ultimately the bourbon inside tastes good, but leaves little lasting impression on its drinker.","Chicken Cock 160th Anniversary is an enjoyable bourbon. Itâs a limited release. Itâs a throwback to a storied brand. It has an 8 year age statement. Itâs just not worth $100.Thereâs no doubt the cost of sourcing bourbon has skyrocketed and the market is willing to pay a premium, but that doesnât necessarily mean a bourbonâs price tag is in line with its value. While itâs released in a beautiful bottle and easily drinkable, itâs no better than many bourbons that can be found for less than $50 on the shelf today, some even less than $30. Being a limited release adds some prestige, and if the brandâs popularity is successfully revitalized with this reboot thereâs no doubt this first edition will be worth its weight in gold. But thatâs not how we rate our value section, and even though the whiskey inside the bottle is good, itâs not worth a Benjamin, plain and simple.",July 2017,Chicken Cock 160th Anniversary
53, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Distillery,82.2,NAS (Aged 4-6 years), $29 (2017),"A youthful nose of corn, ripened bananas, lightly toasted oak, and whiffs of grain. These delicate notes donât carry much depth, and whatâs presented up front is all you get. While the nose probably wonât turn anyone off, I highly doubt it will win over any big fans either.","This is a straightforward and easy to drink whiskey. Simplicity is the name of the game with this bourbon, both in itâs thin mouthfeel and simple flavors. Corn, oak, orange rinds, and light hints of green pepper are all present but none dominates the flavor profile.","The finish is mellow with very little heat throughout. Vanilla, leather, and toasted oak are present. The initial sweetness quickly morphs to a dry oaky finish that lingers for a while and ever so slightly overextends its stay.","A big claim of this bourbon is its unique filtration process. The beech and birch charcoal filter definitely imparts a noticeable layer of toasted oak to the flavor profile. That said, it doesnât do anything to overcome the youthfulness of the bourbon, even though itâs a blend of four to six year old bourbons. What ultimately is presented, is a subpar bourbon that isnât able to stand out from the crowded space itâs playing in and is easily forgotten.","With the bourbon market red hot and more products hitting the market at higher and higher prices every day, it feels like it should be easy to celebrate a bourbon that costs under $30. The problem is, Coopersâ Craft brings nothing new to the table, and doesnât have much to offer. Due to its low proof and lack of a strong flavor profile, this isnât ideal as a sipping bourbon, and at best would be used in a cocktail and more likely in a mixed drink. There are multiple bourbons Iâd recommend for $30 or less that deliver a fuller flavor profile. Honestly, Iâm surprised itâs priced so closely to Woodford Reserve. While Woodford doesnât really break any new grounds, it still delivers a slightly better tasting experience.",Ongoing,Coopers' Craft
54, Straight Bourbon,J.W. Rutledge Distillery,From an undisclosed Kentucky distillery,102,11.5 Years, $150,"A warm and inviting aroma greets you as a bouquet of fruit notes is overwhelming. As it sits, notes of cherry cold medicine, cola, and heavy oak develop and become more pronounced. Its balance of sweet and oak is very satisfying, and its twinge of heat and additional sweetness are welcomed.","Sweet fruit flavors are proudly on display and are reinforced by additional notes of caramel, vanilla, and milk chocolate. This is nicely balanced against a hearty oak and nut element. Overall a decent amount of complexity and mingling of flavors makes this an interesting palate and one thatâs quite fun to drink.","Bitter notes are prominent right out of the gate, followed by heavy oak and walnut, capped off with a flare of heat. By far the weakest and most flawed part of the sip. Despite this setback, it helps counter the strong sweetness of the palate in an agreeable way. The bitterness does become less impactful with subsequent sips, just not enough to completely forget about it.  ","The first release from Jim Rutledgeâs new distillery is noteworthy. He was instrumental in Four Rosesâ growth over the past two decades and it will be fascinating to see the direction he takes his own distillery in. Cream of Kentucky unfortunately isnât his own distillate, instead sourced distillate handpicked by Rutledge himself. This perhaps gives us a peek into the direction he may take his own distillate when it comes of age.  Rutledgeâs version Cream of Kentucky is an interesting one though. Itâs far from straightforward and features a good amount of complexity, while still maintaining a good degree of flavor balance. Itâs quite sweet and fruity which is similar to a Four Roses bourbon, but also offers heavy nut, oak, and bitter notes that arenât typically found in their bourbon. The result is a bourbon that marries what we love from Rutledgeâs product in the past, yet still pushes forward into new territory. ","Cream of Kentucky clocks in at $150, planting it in the realm of limited release pricing. Itâs not necessarily marketed as a limited edition bourbon, yet with a target of 36,000 bottles set to release in 2019, the numbers speak for themselves. Limited, but not that limited.Bourbon with age statements tend to command a higher price nowadays, especially ones in and around the 12 year mark. Barton 1792 just released a 12 year old 1792 for $50. Elijah Craig Barrel Proof still sports its 12 year age statement and asks $60. And then thereâs something like the limited release of Evan Williams 12 Year for $130. So itâs clear not all age statements are created equal. Comparing Cream of Kentucky to 1792 12 Year for instance, there is a clear distinction of quality difference and one can understand the price disparity. Yet, Cream of Kentucky, despite its many positive traits, still suffers from a flawed finish and thatâs where the its price becomes an issue. Itâs within the realm of what the market will more or less accept, but those cracking these bottles to drink will most likely feel they paid too much for what they got.",,Cream of Kentucky Bourbon
55, Blended Canadian Whiskey,Diageo,Crown Royal Gimli Distillery,80,NAS, $30 (2018),"The nose is pleasant and surprisingly lush. Fruit notes dominate with green apple, peaches, pears, and white grapes mingling together. Extremely light notes of vanilla and hay hide in the background.","Immediately upon taking a sip my mouth is hit with a noticeably dry note. The lush fruits that were prominent on the nose are now muddled and mixed with soggy oak, dry leather, and bunked vanilla. The good news is that the low proof allows the whiskey to be swished around  my mouth to hunt out additional flavors. The bad news is the ones that are there are very muted and hard to find. Ultimately the sip delivers a weaker than expected experience.","The muddled flavors from the palate carry through to the finish. It starts with a heavy dose of dry leather and oak, which are present from the start and last until the end. In between, hints of apple, peaches and vanilla waft in, but theyâre light and fleeting. Overall itâs a weaker finish that ends the sip on a disappointing note.","This one will go down in the books as a head scratcher. As in, what was the TTB thinking when they approved this COLA? It begs the question, did this slip by the reviewer or does the TTB not even know their own rules? Either way, give Diageo credit for creating the first Canadian bourbon mash.From a whiskey standpoint though, the product itself is a disgrace to the bourbon name, even if it wasnât technically legal. If youâre going to release a bourbon mash version of your flagship product at least try to bring some of the good with it. While I donât claim to be a regular Crown Royal drinker, I do always have a bottle on hand for my guests who are fans of the brand and Canadian whiskey overall. When comparing Bourbon Mash against the standard product, the nose delivers an ever-so-slightly elevated experience, however the rest of the sip lacks in comparison and doesnât contain the usual carmely rye notes. Iâm not saying that Diageo needed to create a knock-your-socks-off âbourbon,â but if youâre going to add the word bourbon label, at least do some justice to the national spirit of your neighbors down south and make it taste half decent!","As far as a unique collection piece goes, $30 is about as cheap as it comes. You have the chance to own a one-off Canadian âbourbon-thatâs-not-really-a-bourbonâ whiskey, for an incredibly low price. Itâs a talking piece that will be sure to draw conversation among whiskey enthusiasts. Unfortunately, even at this low price, the actual whiskey inside of the bottle isnât worth drinking. Itâs about $10 overpriced, and that may be generous.",March 2018 (Ongoing),Crown Royal Bourbon Mash (Blenders' Mash)
56, Straight Bourbon,Luxco,Undisclosed,100,NAS, $35 (2019),"Aromas of caramel, toffee, gingerbread, and pecan are straightforward and to the point. This makes for a pleasant and easy to parse nose. There isnât a lot of depth, but its aromas blend well and have a welcomed potency.","Noticeably thin at first sip, its oak and nutty notes are hard to ignore and do a lot to make up for its thinness. These flavors provide such a strong backbone to the palate that the bourbonâs other flavors struggle to create their own attention. These sweeter notes of caramel, vanilla, and butterscotch are helpful in working towards a more balanced flavor profile, but just donât quite pull it off. Despite this lopsidedness, it's still quite enjoyable to sip.","Its medium to long finish is oak-forward, creating a rather dry and at times, bitter aftertaste. Rye spice further adds to its rusticness, creating a finish that is deep in barrel influence. It wonât be for everyone, but it surprisingly complements its palate nicely.","The David Nicholson bourbons are yet another brand with a story seemingly steeped in tradition that makes you wonder if it has any relevance to the modern day bourbon drinker. This one in particular comes off a bit thin on the surface as itâs simply a story of a recipe being passed down from generation to generation. Taking it at face value though, similar parallels can be made today. It's a story of a store owner trying to offer his patrons something unique that they could only get at his store. Private selections, oddball blends, and one-off sourcing are more popular than ever with everyone from liquor stores, modern day grocers, to online bourbon enthusiasts groups, websites, and podcasts all following, in a way, what David Nicholson did almost 200 years ago.Except this brandâs story centers around David Nicholson 1843, and not David Nicholson Reserve, which is a high-rye bourbon Luxco sources from an undisclosed distillery in Kentucky (thought to be Heaven Hill). Itâs a very matter-of-fact bourbon, both in its flavor profile and depth. I donât knock its overall quality and rather enjoyed its nut centric palate, but there isnât much it does that will necessarily surprise you.","With Luxco offering this bourbon in more markets, this might be the first time you heard about the brand. Generally found between $35-$40, it settles in an appropriate range a bourbon of its quality and uniqueness might be expected to. Despite wider distribution, it still isnât overly common to find. If your curiosity gets the best of you, that could be worth the few extra bucks. Although paying on the higher end of its price range may make you wish the bourbon had a bit more going on. The result is a price that will have a drastic impact on expectations you place on this bourbon. Think of it this way, Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon and Buffalo Trace Bourbon are enjoyable sippers, but paying $40 for them is a hard sell. The same goes for David Nicholson Reserve.",,David Nicholson Reserve Bourbon
57, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,100,NAS (Press release states 12 Years), $70 (2017),"A light but controlling floral and fruity overtone provides the base for the aromas. Hints of sweet berry, bubblegum, and vanilla lay over the elegant floral base. Very unintrusive notes of rye and oak are present, but barely make in impact. Overall very agreeable and pleasant, but hardly complex.","Flavors lean heavily on the sweet side, but are well composed. Strawberry, cherry, caramel, and vanilla are all bundled together providing the backbone of the flavor profile. They may border on too sweet for some, but perfect for others. Most noteworthy is that theyâre quite gentle and soft in intensity, striking the perfect chord of refinement and approachableness.","Oak and rye spice make an appearance in the finish, and like the rest of the sip, are well disciplined. They donât shout their arrival, but gently introduce themselves and quickly say goodbye. They provide a nice contrast to the sweeter side of the sip, and add a small bit of complexity that the bourbon is missing. The slightest trace of heat also pops during the finish, but overall this drinks on the lighter side for a 100 proof bourbon.","In the current climate of âgimmick bourbons,â a mashbill consisting of four grains is hardly new. Woodford Reserve released one in 2006 as part of their Masterâs Collection. More recently, many craft producers have been experimenting with the idea. But because of limited distribution and marketing reach, most whiskey drinkers probably haven't had the opportunity to try them. What sets E.H. Taylor Four Grain apart from its craft counterparts is Buffalo Traceâs distilling expertise and the relatively high age of this product. In what could have been a muddled mess of flavors, Buffalo Trace managed to do the opposite. This release is actually quite disciplined with its flavors. Despite its lack of complexity, Buffalo Traceâs new mashbill shows quite a bit of maturity and uniqueness for being a first time release.","With many limited releases hitting the market north of $100, Buffalo Trace continues to buck this pricing trend. Itâs certainly a praiseworthy decision, but the current reality of limited release numbers counters any goodwill the company was hoping to gain by the move. Taken as is, E.H. Taylor Four Grain is an excellent example of what a limited edition bourbon should cost and taste in 2017. The problem is few will have the opportunity to purchase it at its MSRP, but through and through, this is a solid bourbon for its MSRP. Comparably to other recent Taylor special releases, I would be willing to pay more for 2015âs Cured Oak, but less for 2016âs Seasoned Wood. With E.H. Taylorâs other whiskeys (Single Barrel, Rye, and Barrel Proof) all costing in the same ballpark as Four Grain, it probably proves that this is priced on the low side for a limited and unique release. That said, it could probably sit comfortably in the $100-$125 range, but for what it is, it easily warrants a $75-$100 price range.",April 2017,E.H. Taylor Four Grain
58, Straight Bourbon	 ,"Sazerac Company, Inc.	",Buffalo Trace,100,NAS (Over 10 years per the company press release),,"Caramel, butterscotch, baking spices, and seasoned oak come together in a rich, fragrant presentation. The overall aroma was borderline incredible with the first pour, but seemed to taper off in its intensity with subsequent pours on the following days. Nevertheless, ethanol is kept in check and the aroma remained complex, inviting, and most notably, interesting with a unique quality I just canât quite put my finger on.","Its thin mouthfeel is immediately noticeable, but this is countered with a vibrant set of flavors. Butterscotch, honey, caramel, summer fruits, and again a touch of oak. Itâs a noticeable step down from the intensity of the aroma, but still enjoyable.","Sweet flavors tease at first, but traces of leather and tobacco quickly develop as well. Some bitterness follows along with a tannic note. Itâs medium-length at best, and feels somewhat abbreviated and subpar compared to the rest of the sip.","Buffalo Trace has many experiments in the works, and in recent years has chosen to honor E.H. Taylor by releasing limited experimental variations of the brand. Attributing this to Taylorâs persona, Buffalo Trace has stated it âhonors Taylorâs enduring spirit of innovation and commitment to exceptional whiskey.â The tenth unique release in the Taylor lineup, Amaranth is the sixth special release and the second to use a unique mashbill. However, while Four Grain had four grains in the mashbill, they still remained the most commonly used grains - corn, rye, wheat, and malted barley. Amaranth is the first of its kind, with no other previous bourbon using the grain in its mashbill. This is surprising considering distilleries like Corsair have released Grainiac (9 grain mashbill) and Insane in the Grain (12 grain mashbill) whiskeys - none of which used amaranth. That being said, Buffalo Trace Mashbill #1 is believed to be 10% rye or less, and since this bourbon used the #1 mashbill with amaranth in place of rye, the percentage of amaranth grain is still relatively small.Amaranth grain is most likened to wheat, and was once a staple of the Aztecs, used in numerous food items. They also used the grain to form images of their gods during the sacred month of Huitzilopochitli, and then at the end of the month ate them in order to take in the gods, which explains the origins of this bourbon's name. Currently, amaranth is popular in gluten free cooking.  Whether itâs the amaranth grain or other contributing factors, the resulting whiskeyâs flavor profile deviates from the norm. It presents like a wheated bourbon, but there is a quality I just canât quite pinpoint. Itâs most prominent in the nose, and as a result the most interesting part of this whiskey.","It might be hard for those reading this to believe, but at one time the full four-bottle standard E.H. Taylor, Jr. lineup was regularly available, even Barrel Proof if you looked hard enough. Sitting amongst the other bottles, both its packaging - tall nicely labelled bottles in tubes - and price felt premium. I considered it a pioneer into regularly available premium bourbon and American whiskey, a category that had hardly been defined at that point in time. Soon after, limited E.H. Taylor releases gained momentum, and before long any limited release under the brand has been met with a rabid fanbase. Like most other limited released theyâve done, Buffalo Trace has kept the MSRP of Amaranth relatively low, in this case $70. But with the three tier system in play and demand at unprecedented levels, the true cost for a retailer to have a bottle (or a few) of Amaranth in stock may be much higher realistically speaking. Additionally, since the time I considered E.H. Taylor a premium brand pioneer, retailers have grown more savvy. Most see it coming and many know it will likely command a premium in the secondary market, making markup hard to pass up. As a result, unless release numbers are excessive, few bottles will actually see store shelves, and if they do, many wonât be priced at MSRP. To that end, $70 for a one-time one-of-a-kind 10+ year old limited release from a strong brand is an easy buy for this whiskey, and if I see any at or around that price you can bet Iâll be buying as many as I can find. However, the bourbon inside the bottle cannot be ignored, and itâs at best a fair price point when its limited status is stripped from the equation. Next to E.H. Taylor Single Barrel, Amaranthâs nose is better and it is more unique overall, but itâs not necessarily a much better bourbon.  ",,E.H. Taylor Jr. Amaranth Grain of the Gods
59, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,100,NAS (Press release states âWell over a decadeâ), $70 (2016),"An immediate greeting of fruit thatâs rather light, which is also an ample way of describing the overall intensity of the nose. Notes of dried berries, oak, and peach are present, but have a shyness to them. Vanilla and caramel are the dominant scents and even they arenât very intense. There is a bit of depth to the nose but it does little to show itself off. Youâll have to actively focus on deconstructing the nose in order to discover them all, as they donât come willingly. What it maybe lacking in intensity makes up for more than a little of it with itâs overall quality of the scents.","A fair amount of oak, butterscotch, and allspice that leans heavily on the nutty side. Oak is ever present throughout, but not to the point of overburdening the palate. The bourbonâs medium weight consistency carries tannins throughout that errs more on the astringent side and less on the bitter side. Itâs surface-level complexity does little to keep my interest, as I find little to delight in here. An average palate from a brand known for much more.","A fair amount of oak, butterscotch, and allspice that leans heavily on the nutty side.

By adjusting the seasoning process for this release (see sidebar), there must have been high hopes at Buffalo Trace that something incredibly unique would come of it.In a way, the reverse seems to have happened. Instead of more intense or layered flavors, the palate tastes like it retracted into itself. The result is a more muted and quite frankly, sheepish palate. The bourbon comes across as having a surface-level complexity with a budget-bourbon tasting experience. Spending time with it reveals some complexities, but far too few to make this anything but an empty experience. I give Buffalo Trace credit for experimenting with a unique process, however the end result is a boring bourbon.","There is always some inherent value when a major company tries something different. Itâs a captivating window into their thought process. Itâs similar to when auto companies build concept cars. Youâll probably never see them in everyday life, but this thinking outside of the box is fascinating for everyone.The modern day E.H. Taylor brand has a short list of special releases. Because of this, they often get increased attention. If Seasoned Wood was released as part of Buffalo Traceâs Experimental Collection, expectations and the inevitable buying frenzy would be greatly tempered. Instead, weâll get a repeat situation of last yearâs E.H. Taylor Cured Oak. Impossible to find except for on the secondary market at five times its MSRP.With any special release - or more experiment in this case - deciding if itâs a good value isnât always obvious. Often times special releases automatically mean higher MSRPs despite what is in the bottle. Buffalo Trace has maintained restraint with the pricing of many of their products including this one. $70 for last yearâs Cured Oak was arguably a fair price. Unfortunately with Seasoned Wood and its lackluster delivery, this same asking price isnât as good this time around. Fascinating experiment or not, whatâs in the bottle just isnât worth its asking price.",March 2016,E.H. Taylor Seasoned Wood
60, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,100,NAS, $40 (2016),"Some bourbons hide their proof and others seem to try to live larger than what they actually are. E.H. Taylor Small Batch is one of those. Lifting the glass up to my nose Iâm greeted with butterscotch, caramel, warmed baked multigrain bread, and hints of liquorice and dried raisins, all of which are undermined by a heavy hanging dose of alcohol. This was surprising to me, as while you sometimes have a little alcohol scent upfront when you get to the 100 proof range, this comes across as excessive. After a few minutes in the glass however, the alcohol scent mostly dissipates and youâre left with a pleasant blend of all of the aforementioned scents.","Plump dried raisins, lightly charred oak, and vanilla are all front and center in this classic palate with a twist. The mouthfeel is nicely balanced and more floral than I expected based on the nose. Overall fantastic in terms of being not too heavy, not too light, just the perfect balance that allows you to hold it in your mouth and really chew on it. Itâs not overly complex, but that doesnât make it any less enjoyable.","Vanilla, light tobacco, leather, and white pepper start the finish off, along with a pleasant burn thatâs isolated to my mouth only. As the finish goes on and flavors dissipate, a dry leathery flavor dusted with a slight hint of white pepper and dried apricot remains. Like the palate, itâs not overly complex, yet itâs still enjoyable. However I do wish it lasted a little longer than it does, as it completely disappears after a minute or two.","At 100 proof, itâs very easy to drink and the flavors are rich and quite enjoyable. For an everyday small batch bourbon, E.H. Taylorâs release is in-line with the rest of the pack. It delivers a quality well balanced flavor profile that is hard to overly critique, yet is also hard pressed to really distinguish itself from say a Buffalo Trace or Four Roses Small Batch. While I was surprised at how alcohol forward it was on the nose, given time to open up, it quickly resolves itself in the glass thankfully.What really wins it over for me though, is that while itâs a small batch variant, it nicely captures many of the same traits that are exhibited in the more expensive E.H. Taylor Single Barrel and is able to do so for $20 less. Iâm not saying its flavor profile is better than the single barrel version, or that the single barrel version is phenomenal, but when a small batch can almost match a single barrel product of itself, thatâs pretty impressive. While not the exact carbon copy flavor wise, it comes satisfyingly close.","While in-line with some of its peers mentioned above, itâs slightly out of line on price. At $40 this is selling for around $10 more than it should be for whatâs in the bottle. Itâs not horribly overpriced, but it is overpriced nonetheless, especially compared to other bottles retailing for $40 such as Maker's 46 or Knob Creek Single Barrel. That being said, Buffalo Trace seems to be pricing this specifically at this price point for a reason. The company has aligned the E.H. Taylor brand as a standalone premium line. It allows the company to differentiate itself from their other products, and in this case gives the impression that the E.H. Taylor Small Batch is a more premium product over their standard Buffalo Trace.In order to make up for the price however Buffalo Trace makes up for it in the packaging, as the E.H. Taylor brand really shines when it comes to their packaging. From the âfauxâ tax strip on their bottles (albeit in orange and not the traditional green for BiB whiskeys), the copious amount of information they list on the bottle, and the tube it comes in, a high amount of detail was put into the packaging for this bourbon. It truly makes for a great bourbon to gift to someone. While this shouldnât be a justification for being priced higher than it deserves, itâs more than many brands currently do to make up for it.",Ongoing,E.H. Taylor Small Batch
61, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,90,10 Years, $29 (2016),"Eagle Rare 10 Year Single Barrel has a subtle yet delicious nose. Upfront I am hit with strong scents of orange peels and citrus mixed with aged oak. Lingering on the nose longer, I pick up scents of toasted marshmallow drizzled with honey. Itâs not the most complex nose, but itâs a really easy nose to pick apart. It's a great choice for someone who has a harder time picking out different scents on the nose because they're prominent and easily distinguished with this one.","The palate is simplistically sweet without a ton of depth. Upfront notes of honey, toasted brown sugar, new oak, and light traces of white pepper are all present. While not deep, itâs very tasty and I would imagine that even a non-bourbon drinker would find it enjoyable. I found myself going back often to sip this throughout the review to taste more of the deliciously sweet palate.","The finish continues the trend of sweetness that is found in the nose and palate. Medium in length, the most predominate notes are bubble gum, toffee, and honey. Light traces of vanilla and dry leather round out the finish. After the delicious palate, I had high expectations for a deeper finish, but that wasnât the case. While not bad per se, itâs also nothing memorable either.","The market for aged single barrels is slowly shrinking and Eagle Rare presents a great opportunity to dive into the single barrel world without spending a lot of money. That being said, the flavor profile it presents isnât super unique. Sweet and subtle, it reminded me of Four Roses Small Batch and E.H. Taylor Small Batch, among other sweeter bourbons on the market. Itâs unique in the sense that itâs one of the few mass produced single barrels on the market, but thatâs about the only unique trait this bourbon has going for it. Furthermore, at any time Buffalo Trace could decide to move this to a small batch brand since the single barrel language has been removed from the new bottles being produced.","Buffalo Trace offers a great range of single barrels all for under $60 with Eagle Rare being the least expensive. While many were dismayed due to the recent removal of the single barrel wording from the label, donât let this deter you. For about $30 or less, youâre receiving a 10 year old single barrel that can be enjoyed by almost anyone. While you can pick up a bottle of Elmer T. Lee single barrel for a few dollars more, you have to realize that Buffalo Trace now has this bourbon on a limited release schedule. For the price and the fact that you can pick this up any day of the year, this should be a staple in every bourbon loverâs bar, as it represents a phenomenal value for a bourbon that can be appreciated by all.",Ongoing,Eagle Rare 10 Year Single Barrel
62, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,90,19 Years, $70 (2013),"Mellow again. It seems like every other new bourbon on the market today is over 100 proof. At 90 proof, Eagle Rare 17 comes off as an easy drinker. Its profile is very well rounded. Its age (19 years) does provide some oak backbone, yet comes nowhere near overpowering any of the flavors. Those flavors include some minor vanilla notes, caramel, cereal, black pepper and even some raisins.","This is a 19 year old bourbon and you can taste it. For a bourbon this old, the oak rounds out the flavor profile more than it dominates it. Some of the mellowness of the oak flavor can be attributed to the 90 proof point but certainly not all: this is a carefully aged bourbon that puts a premium on balance.","A well rounded bourbon is becoming harder to come by. Gimmicks have become the new go-to in bourbon, not perfected flavor. Brands donât strive to be well rounded, they strive to be different in the ever-growing and crowded landscape of bourbonland. Can a bourbon be unique by simply being balanced? Eagle Rare 17âs one blazingly obvious unique trait would be the bourbonâs age. That age allows more flavors to develop, blend and even hide behind other flavors. Older aged bourbons (12 years plus) are becoming a rarity in bourbon as distillers pull barrels early to meet current demand.","Is Eagle Rare 17 three times better value than any of the major brandsâ entry level bourbons? Is it worth double the price of a Woodford Reserve, Russell's Reserve or Markerâs Mark? Probably not, but that solely depends on a personâs experience and palate range. Eagle Rare 17 certainly has a deeper flavor range for those who care to taste. To boil it down to a single point: any spirit aged to 19 years for $70 is a good value.","Eagle Rare 17âs place in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection always seemed like it was meant to represent what basic 90 proof bourbon should strive be. A benchmark. When you think age, you think bourbon. Eagle Rare is one of the oldest bourbon currently on the market. Itâs hard to find fault in a well balanced, well rounded bourbon. What Sazerac 18 yr does for ryes, Eagle Rare does for bourbon. Check your gimmicks at the door.",Fall 2013,Eagle Rare 17 Year 2013 Release
63, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,90,19 Years, $80 (2014)," Itâs a very bright and welcoming nose that is sweet and floral with notes of cherry, orange peel, and pine. There are decent amounts of oak and char under it all, but never does it seem like too much.","This is where the age of the bourbon really comes into play. Itâs heavy on the oak and spice, to the point where it almost overpowers the other flavors. Cinnamon, brown sugar, and leather stick out the most with fainter hints of dark cherry and chocolate underneath.","The spice notes of the palate carry over to the finish. Allspice, nutmeg, and clove flavors develop on the finish while the sweeter elements of the palate completely retreat. The bourbon has a very thin, silky-smooth mouthfeel with little burn.","Last yearâs Eagle Rare 17 Year was a great example of a balanced bourbon. Despite it being in the barrel for 19 years as well, it was a well rounded package of fruity flavors with the perfect amount of oak influence. This yearâs edition, however, was affected by its time in the barrel much more than last year. Iâve been disappointed with almost every high aged bourbon I tasted in 2014. The common theme between them was the oak flavor overshadowed everything else about the bourbon. This is partly true of 2014âs Eagle Rare 17 Year. Oak is present in every aspect of this bourbon yet this is still one of the better recent examples of a high aged bourbon that didn't lose all of its characteristics after resting in the barrel for too long. That makes it unique to some degree but much less so compared to previous years.","It seems like every year Eagle Rare 17 Year and Thomas H. Handy are the two bottles in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection that are the least regarded and sought after in the collection. This is mainly because they both hold high company with George T. Stagg, William Larue Weller, and Sazerac 18 Year. Where those bottles are generally thought to be worth more than their MSRP, Eagle Rare doesnât hold that same esteem. With this yearâs bottle being less balanced with its heavier oak influence, is it still worth itâs asking price?Normally Eagle Rare 17 Year is worth every bit of its MSRP. This year Iâm not sure I can say that. With a $10 increase over previous years, $80 for a decent 90 proof bourbon is asking a lot. Barterhouse (20 yrs), which is on the sweeter side compared to Eagle Rare 17 Year, was priced at $75 and Wild Turkey Diamond Anniversary (blend of 13 & 16 yrs), on the oakier side, was priced at $125, so Eagle Rareâs asking price is within the marketâs range. This was definitely a year I felt the value and quality of Eagle Rare didnât quite match previous years, although itâs still a fair asking price, because overall, itâs still a well-above-average bourbon.",Fall 2014,Eagle Rare 17 Year 2014 Release
64, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,94,12 Years, $28 (2017),"On the sweet side with vanilla, caramel and brown sugar. Fruit also present. Good amount of oak and a little amount of leather on the backside. Everything mingles together evenly.",A little spice at first with sweet notes moving in. Oak and barrel char round it out. Light on complexity but pleasant in flavor.,Dry finish with a hearty amount of oak. Medium length finish with spice that hangs in there until the end.,"The main trait this bourbon has going for it is its age. The above average length  this bourbon spent in the barrel probably turned what would have been a forgettable bourbon into something more noteworthy. Again, this bourbon isnât complex, but it seems to have a perfect amount of oak/char flavor to it.","This is another one of those bourbons that makes you think, âhowâd they do that?â Itâs been aging in a warehouse for 12 years and it only costs $25. It's a great deal. Itâs worth noting that I would have gladly paid more for a more complex palate, and apparently Heaven Hill knows people want this: $20 more nets you a barrel proof version of this bourbon. They also make more complex versions of this in a 20 & 21 year editions that will cost you $150. Apparently thatâs the rub here. Complexity is going to cost you a lot.",Ongoing,Elijah Craig 12 Year
65, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,90,21 Years, $150 (2013),"On the first quick whiff you get a light scent of cereal. Taking a long deep breath pulls out a luscious smell of raisins and dried fruit. Subtle hints of allspice dance in the background but this bourbon knows what itâs doing. There are no harsh alcohol smells at all. This is bourbon thatâs sat around for a while and when it came out of the barrel, it came out with an air of dignity to it. Elijah Craig 21 Year (EC 21) isnât the young guy in the room who wants to pummel your nose with a non-stop bombardment of smells. No, this is a bourbon that knows itâs good, and only after spending time with it will you start to appreciate the subtleness it holds.However, adding 5-6 drops of water to this bourbon instantly brings out additional smells. Lush deep smells of maraschino cherries, vanilla, and a hint of caramel and raisins come rushing at you. I couldnât stop smelling this bourbon after adding water. I could have sat all night just inhaling that deep intoxicating smell.","On first sip you get a long oaky palate upfront. Not as sweet as the nose would lead you to believe, but you definitely pick up light hints of dandelion, aged tobacco, and wood. It just lingers in your mouth for so long that you sit there savoring each sip. Again, adding a few drops totally changes that flavor profile. Youâre treated to a flavor of spicy cinnamon, peaches, cherries, light honey & vanilla. And the best part is that palate flavor lasted just as long upfront.","EC 21 hangs around on your taste buds for dear life as this finish just lasts and lasts and lasts. Just when you thought itâs done, it rears right back at you with a lingering woody taste still, but added to it is subtle hints of allspice and nut.After adding water that finish gets more subtle and less woody. Suddenly subtle tastes of flavors start morphing from one to another. Light ginger, the crispness of a first bite of a fresh snap pea, cotton candy, cinnamon apples, caramel all keep morphing from one to another. In the end though, it comes back to a delicious nonstop lingering dried fruit flavor.  Youâll want to take long pauses and play with this bourbon as all of these flavors keep developing.","Aged bourbons are having their time in the spotlight right now. EC 21 is no exception to this as Heaven Hill released this as a one-off release. Much like EC 20 in 2012 and soon EC 22 in 2014, EC21 is a unique snapshot in time. Whatâs exciting about this EC series is the legacy of EC 18 as a well-loved staple in the Heaven Hill lineup. These high aged releases allow the drinker to see how a loved staple ages as time goes on. It is amazing that for such old bourbon, itâs not overpowered by a woody taste at all. Heaven Hill let this one out right at the perfect moment and is rewarded greatly for it.","The only negative going for this bourbon is value. Itâs an amazing bourbon no doubt, however itâs also almost double the price of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection and $50 more than great bourbons that can be had for a $100. Knowing that EC18 used to sell for $50 and that the this new EC series sells for $150 certainly hurts. Would I recommend buying this bottle? Sure, but only if you realize that you could also get some phenomenal bourbons for a lot less that are just as hard to find.",October 2013,Elijah Craig 21 Year
66, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,90,23 Years, $200 (2014),"This nose is best described as woody, which shouldnât come as much of a surprise since itâs been sitting in the barrel for 23 years. Deep notes of mahogany are up front and present upon first smelling this bourbon. Hiding behind the mahogany are light traces of grain and dried fruit, predominantly dried cherry. While very pleasant, the nose is much more subtle than prior editions of high aged Elijah Craig. It just didn't hold my attention as much as some of the others.Elijah Craig 21 Year opened up a lot with 5-6 drops of water when I reviewed it, so I decided to do the same when tasting this 23 year old. This time around, the water added very little to the overall nose. Instead it tended to enhance the mahogany smell to a fuller, deeper version. Unfortunately this came as a tradeoff since it slightly muted the light traces of grain and dried fruit that were present before adding the water.","Wood, wood, and more woodâ¦this bourbon is an oak monster! Up front youâre hit with a taste of very dried charred oak, which is the predominant flavor profile for this bourbon. Itâs hard to describe just how dry this bourbon is. The best comparison I have is if you were to take a sip of a very dry red wine and have almost all of the moisture sucked right out of your mouth. Additional hints of vanilla, honey and leather linger behind the wood taste.Adding water to the palate greatly enhanced it. While still dry, the palate lost a lot of its wood flavor profile, and instead bursted to life with sweet flavors of honey, dried cherries, apricot, and sunflower seeds (oddly enough!). The palate became very enjoyable after adding the water and even though it didnât enhance the nose, I wouldnât recommend drinking this bourbon any other way.","The dryness of the palate continues through to the finish. A mellow long finish of roasted nuts, leather, aged tobacco and light traces of pepper linger in your mouth.Adding a few drops of water brought out more woody notes to the finish. Wood, dried raisins, and aged leather dominate after adding the water. Even with the water, the finish was long and mellow, and lingered in my mouth for an appreciable amount of time.","Elijah Craig 23 Year continues Heaven Hillâs series of aging their Elijah Craig bourbon a year longer. Starting in 2012 with Elijah Craig 20 Year and continuing every year thereafter, Heaven Hill has continued to age their signature Elijah Craig 18 Year bourbon one more year - giving you a unique chance to sample each year, compare years, and really see how the bourbon tastes with the additional aging. This, in my opinion, has been a really fun series to try out, since it gives you the opportunity to see what the ideal aging time is for Elijah Craig versus a single year release like so many other ultra-aged bourbons (Old Blowhard, Parkers Heritage 27 Year, etc.)And, each of the bottles are single barrels, which provides even more of a unique opportunity since very few ultra-aged bourbons are single barreled. This may not always be a great thing however, since youâre paying a high value for a bottle that may or may not be that great depending on the barrel.","At $200 a bottle, Elijah Craig 23 is well into the super-premium bourbon category. Youâre not paying for a phenomenal taste with this edition. Instead, youâre paying for the privilege to try Elijah Craig aged 23 years. Unlike the EC 21 or EC 22 that command the price premium, this bourbon just falls short of expectations for the price. I would be hard pressed to recommend this bottle at $150 (the cost of prior editions), let alone $200. Even Old Blowhard, which was a 26 year old comparable oak monster, sold for $150.",August 2014 / Ongoing,Elijah Craig 23 Year

It has an overall sweetness that does a good job hiding the high proof.","It welcomes you with heat and dry oak, but also mixes in some sweet caramel. Itâs a blast of flavor all at once like many great barrel proofs are. Fruit notes also become more prevalent as your tongue adjusts to the initial blast of oak and heat.",Itâs moderate to long flavor finishes with a spicy heat that lingers longer than any barrel proof bourbon Iâve tasted. Itâs a fantastic ride of high flavor that continues to reveal more depth even in its finish.  Some amount of bitterness develops late in the game mixed in with the never-ending oak flavor. It has an amazing amount of oak flavor for a 12 year old bourbon. It makes you wonder how another bourbon could pack anymore oak flavor in than this one.,"Barrel proof bourbons are become an ever growing and popular segment of the bourbon business. The long time champion and go-to of high proofers, George T. Stagg, now has much more competition in the likes of E.H.Taylor, Booker's, Stagg Jr, William Larue Weller, 4 Roses, Blanton's and now Elijah Craig. Itâs getting harder to standout in a crowded field. Elijah Craig Barrel Proof doesnât come off as being out-of-this-world unique compared to its competition. The lack of any alcohol taste off of it  and its richness of flavor standout the most.  It's loaded full of flavor but it also packs a good deal of heat.","This is where it gets really interesting. Almost every barrel proof bourbon on the market is priced over $50. The ones close to that amount, Stagg Jr. and Bookers, are generally seen as the least desirable and lowest rated of the barrel proof bourbons. Elijah Craig started off retailing for $35 (it has since climbed to $40-$45). It would be a mistake to look at its price and perceive it as being an inferior product based on it being almost half the price of its competition. It doesnât take a professional bourbon critic to tell you that simply isnât true with this one. Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is hands down the best deal in bourbon.",Ongoing,Elijah Craig Barrel Proof
68, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,94,NAS, $26 (2019),"Vanilla, caramel, nut, and oak pop out from the start. Sweet and light at first, these flavors slightly intensify with time in the glass. On its own, the nose is slightly above average and enjoyable, but also quite simple.","The amount of flavors are on the thin side, with healthy amounts of oak and vanilla dominating. The bourbon has a nice roundness to its mouthfeel that makes it a joy to sip, but it's more of a blunt oaky and sweet vanilla flavor hit, than a complex array of flavors. That said, it's an enjoyable sip.","Cinnamon and oak aftertaste that does a good job lingering long after the sip. Mild heat and intensity is adequate as it is satisfying, but overall the finish is average at best.","Itâs hard to see any age statement go away, but at this point, its 12 Year predecessor seems like a lifetime ago and not all that relevant any more. Truthfully the NAS Small Batch probably aligns to more peoplesâ tastes than the even more oak heavy 12 Year Small Batch did. In the current bourbon climate, drinkers arenât trained to expect much from a $20-$30 bourbon anymore, and Elijah Craig NAS Small Batch exemplifies this. Far from a bad bourbon, it happily settles for âjust enoughâ or âgood enoughâ in its current form. It fits right in line with what its contemporaries offer for better or for worse and is a solid and agreeable pour for a decent price. It just doesnât stand out like it once did.","It quite amazing that Heaven Hill has been able to maintain Elijah Craigâs mid-$20 price point for such a long period of time. Even its contemporaries, Buffalo Trace and Four Roses Small Batch said goodbye to their $20 price point some time ago. We wrote about the disappearing $20 range of bourbons, yet Elijah Craig has managed to skirt this trend and become (or at least maintained its position as) one of the main poster-bourbons of the price range. Even the brandâs excellent private selectionsoften cost only a few dollars more than the NAS Small Batch. No one wants to pay more and get less, and in a way that is what Heaven Hill gave us in 2016 when changing this into a NAS small batch bourbon. Yet, the change wasnât as damaging to the bourbon and its value as drinkers feared, thanks to the strong and quality base Elijah Craig bourbon is crafted on. In its current form, it might not offer the value it once did, but itâs still a solid buy for its price.",Ongoing,Elijah Craig Small Batch

This bourbon has a nose that doesnât overpower you.  Instead, it offers a package of light, sweet smells that make you think that someone served you dessert in the form of a glass full of bourbon.","Upon tasting this bourbon, I was treated to hints of peach, dried raisin, and maple candy. This was quickly followed by a burst of wood and spice akin to pre ground black pepper, which is expected out of a 12 year bourbon and one that uses Buffalo Traceâs #2 mashbill.","The finish on this was long and very dry. The spice disappeared and was replaced with leather, aged wood, and tobacco leaves that lingered in my mouth. Sitting and thinking about this finish brought visions of Elmer sitting in a rocking chair and enjoying a glass of his own bourbon while overlooking the bluegrass of the Kentucky countryside. A really delightful finish thatâs indeed simple and easy to enjoy.","While lower in proof than most single barrels, this bourbon still provides a lot of good flavor, especially considering itâs been sitting in wood for 12 years. As far as single barrelâs go, this is a nice bourbon. It wonât knock your socks off in its nose, palate or finish. But, overall it still delivers a very well balanced product.","This bourbon is often overlooked. But, for less than $35 Elmerâs is a steal. Are there better single barrels out there? Sure, even ones that share the same #2 mashbill from Buffalo Trace (ala Blantonâs). However, for the price, you canât beat Elmerâs.

70, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Old Evan Williams Distillery,107,23 Years, $350 (2019),"Heavy aged oak is immediately noticeable but by no means overpowering. Digging deeper reveals classic scents such as vanilla and caramel, along with scents of marshmallow, creme brulee, and syrup. The nose is surprisingly rich and for such an old bourbon bringing forth a nice mixture of sweet along with oak. Interestingly enough, there is only the faintest hint of ethanol.","The sip starts with a bit of tannic wood which is immediately joined with sweeter flavors. The result is a big hit of sweet vanilla along with hard cherry candy, honey, seasoned oak, cigar box, and black pepper. The higher proof shows through and adds a little bit of fiery heat to the sip. A medium bodied mouthfeel delivers a surprisingly sweeter and more flavorful sip than expected for a 23 year old bourbon.","Unlike the nose and palate, the finish shows just how long this bourbon has spent in the barrel. Father time is evident as the sweetness found earlier is replaced by drier notes. The fiery heat carriers over from the palate and is joined by wood, pepper, and light cherry Halls. The heat lingers with traces of dry leather and tannic wood, making for a longer than necessary finish, and one that doesnât quite live up to what the nose & palate delivers.","Evan Williams 23 Year is an oddball in the Evan Williams family line. The next oldest Evan Williams is 12 years version that is only available in the gift shop and overseas, while the current standard available expressions all fall below 10 years of age. To see an expression aged so far from its siblings is unique in and of itself, however being aged to 23 years is where things start to get interesting.   There aren't many ongoing releases of 23 year old bourbons out there. In fact there are only three in total, the other two being Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year and Elijah Craig 23 Year. Because bourbon is aged in charred new oak barrels, itâs not meant to be aged for a long time compared to what you might find in a scotch or other whiskeys that utilize pre-used barrels for the aging process. Bourbon aged over 20 years just doesnât deliver a lot of flavor outside of oak. Additionally, once you get to this age, there just isnât much bourbon left in the barrel to bottle, and sometimes barrels are completely empty by this point. In tasting Evan Williams 23 Year next to Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year, I found both to have their own traits to appreciate, with Evan Williams delivering heavier notes. However compared to its sibling from the same distillery, I found Evan Williams 23 Year brought about a much more flavorful sip between the two. In both cases I credit this to Evan Williamsâ higher proof content. Being bottled at 107 proof makes Evan Williams 23 Year the only 23 year old over 100 proof, which in this case correlates to a more nuanced and flavorful sip.","No matter how you try to justify it, $350 is a lot of money for a bourbon regardless of the age. In Evan Williams case, it happens to be priced well above the MSRP for Elijah Craig 23 Year and even Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year, both of which manage to stay in the $200-$300 MSRP range. Many will scoff at MSRP since secondary will be much much greater, but MSRP allows us to compare apples to apples. Off the cuff you might think that this is a horrible value, however the price alone doesnât tell the whole story. What stops this from being an absolute horrible value is the fact that the flavor profile is actually quite nuanced for such an old bourbon. Additionally, its 107 proof has to be taken into account for the value. By the time the bourbon has aged 23 years, only a very little remains in the barrel. Where Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year and Elijah Craigh 23 Year get proofed down to 95.6 and 90 proof respectively, Heaven Hill only proofs down Evan Williams 23 Year to 107 proof. This means that there is even less to bottle from each batch that they process for this line. So yes, this isnât a good value in the grand scheme of things, however itâs also not a bourbon to avoid purley based on price either. ",,Evan Williams 23 Years Old
71, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,100,NAS, $15 (2017),"Loads of sugary sweetness. Vanilla, caramel, a hint of gingerbread, and candied dark fruit pour forth from the glass in a balanced array sweet scents. Itâs light on alcohol and absent of any woody or oak notes making it quite nice, albeit heavy handed with the sweeter elements.","It almost flattens out on my tongue, settling in the base of my mouth without the spicy, tingly pop on the roof of my mouth that I sometimes notice with higher proof bourbons. Like the nose, flavors of wood and oak are absent here, as sweet notes of vanilla, caramel, burnt brown sugar, and a touch of black pepper take over. Itâs full flavored and assertive with a welcomed amount of heat, though I would still describe it as smooth for its proof. It has character, but itâs not complex by any means as it has a somewhat one-dimensional focus on sweeter elements.","The sweet elements from the palate dissipate quickly with a crisp and abrupt drop-off. A subtle bit of oak creeps in after that, giving way to a fairly dry, medium-length finish.","As many Heaven Hill brands share the same mashbill and similar age range, itâs not surprising that the overall flavor profile is a somewhat familiar one. I compared it directly with Evan Williams Black, Heaven Hill BiB, and Henry McKenna BiB. Iâll save the detailed results of the comparison for a future Breaking Bourbon Face Off, but in simple terms side by side, each of these bourbons does offer its own distinguishing characteristics, as subtle as they may be. Not surprisingly, Evan Williams Black offers the closest comparison in flavor profile, and while the BiB version has an all around fuller flavor profile and heavier mouthfeel, some wood and fruit characteristics not found in the BiB version make an appearance in the Black. Evan Williams BiB is just one of the numerous non age-stated Heaven Hill bourbons and while itâs flavor profile is more traditional and somewhat one-dimensional, it still offers subtle characteristics unique to the brand and delivers them in its own unique way.","While you could compare this directly with Heaven Hill BiB (6 year old) at $12 and say the Evan Williams BiB is younger and more expensive at $15, I would argue that youâre just comparing two bourbons that both offer exceptional value. Despite the lack of an age statement (though a minimum of four years can be inferred from the label), Evan Williams BiB is actually a five year product according to Heaven Hill Brand Ambassador Bernie Lubbers, so really just one year shy of Heaven Hill BiB. The flavor profiles are also different, with Evan Williams BiB trading a bit of Heaven Hill BiBâs balance for some additional character and sweetness. Furthermore, while we know the distribution of Heaven Hill BiB is quite limited outside of Kentucky, Evan Williams BiB is distributed nationwide. As a result, the added cost of a trip to Kentucky to pick up some Heaven Hill BiB (not to mention a few Willetts, some gift shop only releases, every other BiB whiskey known to man, followed by a week of sleeping alone on the couchâ¦) might help justify the $3 price increase youâll pay for the Evan Williams BiB at your local store.While there isnât anything about Evan Williams BiBâs flavor profile thatâs necessarily great, there really isnât anything bad about it either. Tasting it blind, Iâd wager most would guess its MSRP to be north of $25. By that measure itâs a tremendous value for only $15.",Ongoing,Evan Williams Bottled in Bond
72, Straight Bourbon,Luxco,Heaven Hill,99,12 Years, $38 (2017),"Despite the nose giving off a sweet scent, very little of the palate reciprocates it. The bourbonâs medium bodied palate is surprisingly lacking. Spice, cinnamon and wood are the most prevalent of flavors, overpowering any amount of sweetness that tries to come through at first sip.",Whatever flavors develop in its palate quickly fall off the map during the bourbonâs finish. It has one of the shortest finishes Iâve had. Itâs also surprisingly quite dry for such a sweet smelling bourbon. One thing it does have going for it is that itâs a smooth 99 proof pour. The bourbon goes down smooth and is easy to drink. Ezra B isn't an unpleasant experience but is quickly forgettable.,Ezra B Single Barrel has an amazing nose on it. Itâs easily above average. Its palate and finish simply fall flat. It finishes so quickly that itâs hard to even have time to be unique. The bottle design with its use of blue wax and ribbon may be the most unique aspect of this bourbon - if youâre into that sort of thing.,"Depending on where you live, this bourbon has quite the range in price. Being a 12 year at 99 proof and under $35, itâs not a bad value until you compare it to other bourbons in its class. Compared to the benchmark of $30 range bourbons, Four Roses Single Barrel, it doesnât come close. Under $30 is the price range this bourbon should be bought at.","This is a bourbon that starts off great but quickly goes downhill. Its beautiful sweet nose is rendered obsolete by the time you arrive at the bourbonâs dry finish. Thereâs nothing inherently bad about this bourbon, it just falls short of being anything meaningful and memorable. Itâs a descending ride to boresville.",Ongoing,Ezra B 12 Year Single Barrel
73, Bourbon,FEW Spirits LLC,FEW Spirits,93,Less than 4 Years, $50 (2017),"Cherries, rich caramel, and seasoned wood mingle with burnt brown sugar and other scents I canât quite zero in on. This complex array of scents is wrapped in young grains and balanced with a light spicy burn. Even though itâs rough around the edges, itâs actually quite enjoyable and not a turn-off considering how obviously young it comes off. Itâs an odd mix of wonderfully interesting and strangely inviting, yet obviously under-aged.","Big corn and spice upfront. The graininess becomes much more evident here and it starts to take a turn for the worst. Bits of caramel and vanilla tease through, but whatever potentially good flavors that were noticed on the nose are overpowered by grain and alcohol.","The downhill momentum continues into the finish. It becomes bitter, tannic, and almost sour. Hints of oak and a light sweetness are present, but overpowered by the tannic flavors. It ends on its lowest note.","The interesting aspect about craft bourbons is each is unique in its own right. FEW is no exception. While I personally dislike the flavor of this particular bourbon, I will also say I donât have anything else in my cabinet that tastes like it. It has the potential to be a far better bourbon if it could spend more time in the barrel to smooth out the rough edges and allow the complexity noticed on the nose to show through into the palate and finish. Alternatively, maybe the smaller barrels used for aging are bringing in too many tannins, and FEW should just move to larger barrels and longer aging altogether to allow this bourbonâs real potential to show through.Despite the lack of any specific evidence of a difference in flavor profile created by Minnesota oak, it is something not otherwise discussed by other distilleries and likely has an impact on the final flavor. Moreover, itâs evident that FEW takes care in controlling their process right down to the wood used to make their barrels which is a promising sign from an exciting upstart distillery that seems to be doing just about everything right.","Value is tricky when it comes to craft whiskeys. As you may have noticed, we donât review too many limited distribution craft whiskeys and instead focus on whiskeys with widespread distribution, which is somewhat by design. Itâs not that we donât appreciate locally-distributed craft, in fact, itâs the opposite. We prefer to write up distillery tours and talk in a general sense, as we understand take-off can be a little bumpy and these craft distillers are working with what they have - limited budgets, limited time to age and bring to market, their own learning process, etc. While some of the largest distilleries can deliver pretty decent 4 year-old plus bourbons for under $20, that is obviously not the mark we set for craft distillers and as a result, reviews of new and highly limited distribution craft whiskeys may come across unnecessarily harsh when, in fact, we really do support the craft movement.Like a number of other craft distillers FEW Spirits has achieved fairly widespread distribution, so a comparison with mainstream competition is arguably fair. FEW Rye received the Craft Whiskey of the Year in 2013 from Whiskey Advocate and was scooped off the shelves immediately - although I havenât tasted it yet I still have my hopes up. Whether FEW Rye can compete nationally is not the topic here though, the whiskey in review is FEW Bourbon. In order to appreciate this one I think youâll need to have a connection with the distillery in some way, no different than many other craft spirits and in that case it will feel fairly priced. Without that connection though itâs just another $50 bottle of bourbon amongst many others. It's flavor profile is just too rough and under-developed to warrant its price or ability to fairly compete with other widely distributed bourbons in the $50 price range.",Ongoing,FEW Bourbon Whiskey
74, Straight Bourbon,Fighting Cock Distilling Company,Heaven Hill,103,NAS, $20 (2018),"Banana forward with light vanilla, walnut, and oak in the background. It doesnât have a complex aroma, but its simplicity doesnât mean itâs boring either. In fact, itâs quite inviting. There is zero ethanol present, which for a sub $20 higher proof bourbon, is surprising.","Super sweet with a touch of heat. The palate has a nice mouthfeel, and is dominated by baked bananas drizzled with syrup. Additionally, you get a nice amount of heat via a mixed black and white pepper combination, which ends up complementing the sweeter notes. While the palate is also on the simpler side, itâs very enjoyable.","The finish is contrasting compared to the sweeter nose and palate that come before it. The peppery heat carries through to start the finish, and is joined with oak and leather to form a drier overall finish profile. The finish is shorter and disappointingly ends rather abruptly without any fanfare.","If this had this been a few years ago, a majority of this section would have been celebrating Heaven Hill for releasing a surprisingly drinkable six year old bourbon under $20. It also would have most likely been described a much more âfieryâ bourbon with a kick, which is how a majority of people described their experience with the 6 year age stated bourbon.Unfortunately, thatâs not the case today. While its value is commendable, the fact of the matter remains that itâs a NAS bourbon with a more simplistic flavor profile. This is certainly not unique nowadays, but other sub $20 bourbons like Heaven Hill BIB and Four Roses Yellow at least bring an extra memorable element to their flavor profiles. Credit needs to be given to Fighting Cock for how drinkable it is at 103 proof, however along those same lines, I was also surprised to see the lack of flavor for a 103 proof bourbon, which is a shame.","Often times people have preconceived notions that if a bourbon is on the bottom shelf and sells for under $20, it must not be that great. Fighting Cock helps to break that perception and delivers an easy to drink bourbon that can be appreciated by anyone. While the nose and palate are simple and the finish is short and dry, overall this is an enjoyable bourbon for the price. Fighting Cock holds up well when compared to its competition in this value price range, especially for the price being offered.",Ongoing,Fighting Cock Kentucky Straight Bourbon
75, Straight Bourbon,Diageo/Orphan Barrell Whiskey Distilling Co.,New Bernheim Distillery,90.5,15 Years, $65,"A very sunny nose filled with caramel, honey, and vanilla notes. While many bourbons also carry these aromas, few come off this sweet. This is surprising for a 15-year-old bourbon since older bourbons are usually weighed down with heavy oak notes. While the nose also sports leather and toasted oak, theyâre quite tame and mingle well with the other aromas. If I didnât know this bourbonâs age, I would guess itâs much lower than 15 years based on its nose.","The sweetness of the nose is noticeably absent on the palate and is replaced with doses of leather, cedar, and smoke. I would call these barrel flavors overpowering, but that doesnât even cover it because there just arenât any other flavors present for them to overpower. Try hard enough and you might be able to taste minor hints of maple and dark cherries. This is an extremely boring one-dimensional palate. I donât think Iâve ever had a bourbon that is so spiritless.","There is more peppery rye spice on the finish but thatâs about it. The dry finish doesnât quite hit you at first, but it definitely sticks around. Thereâs nothing wrong with a dry finish, but one that doesnât also ride out with other flavors makes for an extremely flat and dull experience.","Iâm repeatedly crestfallen with each Orphan Barrel release and I donât know why I never learn my lesson. On paper these releases always seem so unique. Their mystery origins, high age statements, and brilliant bottle/label design continues to put a spell on me. My main complaints with each release have been their over-oaked and under-flavored palates. Where most of the releases have had a decent flavor foundation that showed at least some potential, Forged Oak doesnât even have that.For a bourbon to sport only barrel-related flavors is pretty unique. This can be expected of any ultra-aged bourbon, but one aged at only a slightly high 15 years makes this all the more perplexing. Curiosity aside, a flavor profile consisting only of leather, cedar, and smoke doesnât sound that appealing and it tastes even worse. Where all of the other Orphan Barrels suffered from a low proof point, Forged Oakâs equally low proof is probably what saves it from being a complete abomination. Yes, thereâs a lot of oak flavor, but itâs the 90.2 proof that keeps the intensity of the oak flavor at manageable levels. If you ever wanted to have the experience of tasting what a really old whiskey is like, hereâs your chance in a 15-year-old bottle.","With three out of five bottles in the Orphan Barrel line all retailing close to $100 or more, Forged Oakâs $65 MSRP is certainly more attractive. There also isn't a lot of available bourbons on the market in this above-average age range. Itâs the high age statements of the Orphan Barrel line that are its best selling point. The age and price alone are what will sell Forged Oak and that is whatâs unfortunate. There are so many better and less expensive bourbons on the market that deserve the attention that Forged Oak will undoubtedly get. Sure, itâs a great value for the age, but itâs not a great value for the quality of the bourbon you're buying. This has been a recurring statement with each Orphan Barrel release.",February 2015,Forged Oak
76, Straight Bourbon,Kirin Brewery Company,Four Roses,103.2,"Blend of OBSV (18yrs), OBSK (13yrs), and OESK (13 yrs)", $85 (2013),"Bringing the glass up to my nose, I was greeted with a delicious mixture of smells. Light traces of wheat, fresh berries and floral smells stand out with subtle aftertones of fresh nuts and new wood. I was surprised to find that for a 100+ proof bourbon, you have to try very hard to pick up even the slightest hint of alcohol. No burn here, just a wonderfully scented whiskey that I kept going back to to smell more of throughout the tasting.","What jumped out to me immediately was a mixture of old leather and aged cedar like a cigar box. Additionally, the berry smell from the nose continues on in the palate and you get light hints of sweet berries and dried fruit. An odd combination, but it blends surprisingly well.","The finish on this was very mild and shorter than I would have preferred. You have a big buildup in the nose and palate, but the finish left me wanting more than what it delivered. The finish was dry like aged leather with hints of tobacco leaves. I also picked up subtle traces of slight bitterness like an orange rind.","While Four Roses releases a limited edition small batch every year, this version is as unique as it gets. The normal small batch recipe uses four strains (OBSO, OBSK, OESK, OESO) versus the three strains found in the 125th Anniversary edition (OBSO at 18yrs, OBSK at 13yrs, OESK 13 yrs). Itâs really interesting to see how modifying what is blended together for this release changes the flavor profile from a normal small batch bottle. Only 12,468 total bottles were released (approximately 8,000 bottles in US markets) and like most limited edition Four Roses releases, this version was snapped up very quickly by the general public.","At $85, this is almost three times the price of a normal bottle of Four Roses small batch. While itâs nice to try different flavors and say that you've sampled a one-off bottle from Four Roses, I have a hard time justifying the price. The normal small batch release is quite a steal at $30 and is really good for the price. Comparing the 125th Anniversary release to the everyday small batch, I walked away feeling slightly disappointed with it. At $85, I was expecting a bourbon that would blow me away - one that was so much more than the usual small batch release.",September 2013,Four Roses 2013 Limited Edition Small Batch

Itâs quite easy on the nose considering the proof. While pleasant, itâs easily forgotten.","A tidal wave of flavor bursts forth, coating my mouth with a rich, velvety feel. Summer fruits provide the base of flavor, with seasoned oak, caramel, rye spice, and a bit of honey balancing things out. The delicious combination of flavors with its fruit-forward base is oddly unique, yet familiar and traditional at the same time.","The finish is really where this bourbon shines. Seasoned oak slowly overtakes the summer fruits, caramel, and honey but allows their sweetness to remain. It lasts and lasts with hints of rye spice and burnt brown sugar appearing later, adding a satisfying layer of dimension. Itâs exceptional and leaves a memorable impact.","Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch is known for its high quality and uncompromising balance. Being the first solo Limited Edition Small Batch release from Master Distiller Brent Elliott, the ultimate question is âhow does this compare to years past?â Elliott has worked alongside Jim Rutledge in selecting the bourbons that made up the Limited Edition Small Batch blends for years, and in our interview with him earlier this year described struggles with Rutledge in agreeing on the blend that would ultimately become the 2014 Limited Edition Small Batch. While Iâve only had one pour of the 2014, it failed to make a lasting impression on me.Elliottâs background is in chemistry and his former role with Four Roses was in quality control. While Four Roses has mastered consistency with their standard bourbon lineup, their Limited Edition releases deviate from simply matching already established flavor profiles as they strive to seek out something both exceptional and unique representing the best the distillery has to offer. As Elliott says in reference to Limited Edition Small Batch creation, âIâm not really satisfied until it consistently, in my opinion, is as good or better than previous releases.â Arguably, this weights individual taste preference much more heavily in the equation, presenting both the opportunity for success along with a greater risk of failure.So how does Elliottâs taste preference differ from Rutledgeâs when it comes to selecting barrels and establishing a flavor profile for Limited Edition Small Batch releases? Only time will really tell and Rutledgeâs shoes are big ones to fill, but this yearâs Limited Edition Small Batch is top notch. While I have not tasted or deeply evaluated every Limited Edition Small Batch released by Four Roses to date, 2016 stands out as my favorite so far demonstrating not only impeccable balance true to the brand, but also a memorable flavor profile to go along with it.","While itâs generally of similar quality to other highly sought after limited releases, anecdotally speaking Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch has not experienced the level of âfrenzyâ as others in the category, including most in the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection and Pappy Van Winkle lineups. The MSRP on Limited Edition Small Batch has climbed rapidly in just a few years, from around $85 in 2013 to $129 in 2016, though actual price will vary a bit by state and some retailers will certainly mark that up. Keeping in mind that this is still going to be difficult to find near MSRP, those who put in the time might find the opportunity to purchase at retail more easily than other highly revered limited editions in the category.Considering the quality of this vintage and what is happening in the greater bourbon marketplace right now, $129 is a fair price. This is worth your consideration if faced with a choice amongst other limited edition releases this year, especially considering the generally disappointing Buffalo Trace Antique Collection and Knob Creek 2001 Limited Edition lineups.",September 2016,Four Roses 2016 Limited Edition Small Batch

Repeat nosings bring out dried raisins, vanilla, and hints of pine. Overall itâs easy to dissect and enjoy.","A delicate yet robust delivery of summer fruits, fried dough, allspice, pine, and apricot. The flavors blend surprisingly well and donât muddle, which make for an interesting flavor profile. The overall intensity of heat and flavors is well matched, producing a flavorful and really enjoyable pour.","The heat and robustness ramps up on the finish, crescendoing in a warming oak and spice mix. Itâs less complex than the rest of the sip, but bookends the bourbon nicely. Itâs classic Four Roses through and through.","Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch has a great track record year after year of high quality blended bourbon. A lot of this has to do with each release striving for a more delicate and homogeneous flavor presentation. Simply put, theyâre the opposite of in-your-face bourbons. Theyâre sophisticated and complex, asking for drinkers to explore the flavors and pull out their nuances. This is an increasingly rare occurrence. Expert blending might be on the upswing, but Four Roses has been a master of it for some time and proves it year after year.This editionâs average age clocks in a few notches lower than previous years, which seems to have added some extra spunk. The palate is much more robust and lively, and the flavors a bit more unusual. The oak influence is very much present, yet it is more equally distributed. 2018 Limited Edition Small Batch still tastes like a Four Roses product, but with a much welcomed flavor twist added in. This is exactly what a limited edition blend should be from Four Roses: a nice balance of classic and new.","It's hard to argue that Four Roses isnât one of the premier blenders currently bringing blends to the market. Yet more than once Iâve passed on a bottle of their limited releases. Is it because of the price? Like most limited releases, the price of this release has steadily risen over the years. Itâs still priced respectably for what it is and compared to its competition, yet I still donât always pull the trigger.Release after release the companyâs blends are well executed and nicely nuanced, but that is where the problem may lie. Too often limited releases are bombastic screaming for attention. Four Roses limited editions are the opposite. Theyâre shy and gracious, perhaps too much. There are also Four Rosesâ other everyday releases that are extremely consistent and reliable products, which sometimes makes it hard to justify spending that much more for their limited editions. This yearâs release seems to have found a nice middle ground. It has a bit more pop than previous limited editions, but is still built on the complexity that these releases are known for. Itâs a satisfying balance that easily justifies its value.",September 2018,Four Roses 2018 Limited Edition Small Batch 130th Anniversary Edition

Nuanced scents of aged oak, preserved red fruits, and cinnamon, mingle with a light floral and pine needle undertone. The higher proof doesnât impact the experience at all, as no hints of ethanol are present. Itâs slightly more distinguished from a pour of standard Four Roses Â Small Batch, but just barely.","A big burst of canned peaches and syrup with a dollop of cream, fresh custard, rye spice, vanilla, and honey. The palate is incredibly sweet with loads of depth. The flavors unfold with complex elegance the more you roll the whiskey around in your mouth. Doing so also allows you to appreciate how much of an overall creamy-rich mouthfeel the sip delivers.","The sip ends with a warm finish. It starts with vanilla, pie crust, rye spice, red hot candy, and a touch of oak. These flavors transition to a cinnamon and leather mix that lingers before finishing on a note of aged oak. An overall pleasant way to end the sip.","Four Roses always delivers a unique combination of recipes and ages when it comes to their Limited Edition Small Batch releases, and this yearâs release is no exception. Featuring for the first time ever a 21 year-old bourbon in one of their releases helps distinguish this yearâs release from years past. Its flavorful and rich palate helps to drive that point home. In comparing it against a pour of standard Four Roses Small Batch, this yearâs Limited Edition Small Batch is head and shoulders better. Since the introduction of Small Batch Select, the gap between a standard release and a Four Roses limited release product is smaller than ever. Â While this year's limited edition is slightly sweeter on the palate with a little more muted spice and more defined oak in the finish, it doesnât quite shine as bright as youâd expect it too comparably. This isnât necessarily a knock against this year's Limited Edition Small Batch however, as it just goes to show you how impressive Small Batch Select is, and the high bar master distiller Brent Elliott now has to reach for his limited edition releases to overcome going forward. ","Four Roses has consistently been a champion of the consumer when it comes to pricing. The companyâs great Small Batch can often be had for under $30, their equally impressive Single Barrel for under $50, and the new Small Batch Select for $55. Thatâs why the jump up to $140 for the Limited Edition Small Batch always feels like a shocker. In its defense, Limited Edition Small Batch usually contains a unique blend of recipes and ages not found in their other products. While this especially holds true for this yearâs edition with the inclusion of a 21 year old bourbon into the blend, as a side effect of the introduction of Small Batch Select, itâs harder to justify Limited Edition Small Batch's massive price difference as being anything above average. Yes, this yearâs blend still uses high aged bourbons and a combination of three recipes, however those same three recipes comprise three out of the four recipes found in Small Batch Select. While the ages of the bourbon used are almost double or triple that of Small Batch Selectâs blend, the sip offered isnât as big of an increase comparably. Many should take solace in the fact that they can get a pretty close drinking experience by finding a bottle of Small Batch Select for less than half the price.",,Four Roses 2019 Limited Edition Small Batch

Truly a delicious tasting bourbon that makes me want to continuously go back and drink more.","This bourbon delivers a long, lingering finish, which has the exact opposite spice effect of the palate. With the palate, youâre greeted with spice upfront, quickly followed by a blast of flavors. With the finish, youâre initially greeted with very little spice, however that changes as my mouth is slowly filled with a delicious spicy heat over a minute or two. This spicy heat then takes another minute to slowly dissipate from my taste buds. Layered in between the rye spice are flavors of leather, old wood, mint, dried raisins, and cherries along with vanilla coated peaches. The length of this finish cannot be understated as it just keeps going and going.","Compared to other single barrels on the market, this one stands out for me due to the large amount of sweetness the palate contains, along with the large amount of rye in the mashbill. This bottle is well-balanced and full of flavor that smacks you around from start to finish. With the higher rye content, the flavor profile is unlike something youâd see coming out of Buffalo Trace or Heaven Hill. Iâm usually hesitant to read a distilleryâs description of a bottle, however the standard bottling Four Roses OBSV recipe really does live up to its description of âdelicate fruit, spicy, and creamy.âSingle barrel bourbons, while unique, arenât exactly rare nowadays. However what makes Four Roses stand apart is that they have 10 different recipes they use when making their blended bourbon. This means that they also have 10 different variations of single barrel recipes they can use for their Single Barrel product. While the standard bottling is always offered as OBSV at 100 proof, part of the fun of the Four Roses Single Barrel line is trying each recipe and finding what you like. This can also have a downside to it though, since non-standard bottlings can only be found as private picks.

Four Roses delivers a bottle full of flavor that rewards you for spending your hard-earned money on the bottle. Sure, compared to other Four Roses products, (Four Roses Yellow and Four Roses Small Batch) the Single Barrel line costs more, however it also delivers a much more robust flavor profile.

While Single Barrel is without question a better bourbon, it comes with a 33% increase in price. Because of this, Small Batch is perfectly priced within its own lineup, but also offers great value relative to many other bourbons in the $30 price range.

Thes 10 recipes each deliver a slightly different flavor profile and when blended, create a unique drinking experience.

Until now the blends were only offered in two readily available formats - Four Roses Small Batch which uses 4 recipes, and Four Roses Bourbon which uses up to all 10 recipes. Four Roses also offers a limited release blend about once a year, but itâs not readily available.It turns out that utilizing 6 of the 10 recipes and upping the proof is the sweet spot for Four Roses for this new readily available blend. The combination of recipes chosen and additional proof ends up delivering a richer overall sip compared to Four Rosesâ other blended bourbons. In particular, when compared directly to Four Roses Small Batch, Small Batch Select delivers a slightly creamier and richer sip. Yes the Single Barrel variation can deliver some stunning bottles now and then, however Small Batch Select should consistently deliver a unique sip with a great palate every time. ","While it may be unique compared to its siblings, Four Roses Small Batch Select is also the most expensive in the Four Roses family now. Coming in at almost double the price of Four Roses Small Batch, and even more than Four Roses Single Barrel, its value discussion gets tricky. Yes the flavor profile is really unique, and the sip enjoyable, however it isnât a large enough difference to justify its price. This isnât a knock against Small Batch Select by any means, instead itâs more an acknowledgement of the value Four Roses delivers in their other three standard expressions. In regards to the rest of the market, Small Batch Select is priced right. It doesnât deliver the depth that a more fuller proof bourbon may deliver or the complexity that slightly longer aging often brings. However it delivers a consistent sipper at a price that is fair compared to its peers.  While it may seem expensive when viewed in the prism of Four Roses own brand lineup, its excellent palate, expected consistency, and wide availability all help to make Small Batch Select a decent overall value.",,Four Roses Small Batch Select Bourbon
83, Straight Bourbon,Kirin Brewery Company,Four Roses,86,NAS, $50 (2015),"Lighter, with floral and sweet notes along with the faintest hint of alcohol. All of your classic bourbon profile flavors are present with toasted brown sugar, vanilla, and light oak immediately jumping out. Behind these flavors lay hints of peaches and light crisp summer fruits. While itâs not deep, itâs subtle and pleasant and everything youâd expect out of a well-rounded Four Roses bourbon. Letting this sit out for 20-30 minutes really opens up the nose and the floral and sweet notes are enhanced with time in the glass.","The sweetness of the nose carries right through into the palate. Here the fruit characteristics found in the nose shine through a bit brighter, along with a healthy dose of vanilla and the slightest touch of oak. While Four Roses Super Premium may be lighter in proof than what one might be used to when drinking a Four Roses Small Batch or Single Barrel, it certainly doesnât taste watered down. The palate wonât blow anyone away, however itâs a simple, sweet profile that I feel any novice or experienced bourbon drinker would appreciate and find quite enjoyable.","The finish is short to medium in length, and brings with it a nice little set of flavors to ponder over. It starts light and sweet with honey and vanilla upfront. Over the next minute it then morphs to the drier side with aged oak and leather shining through, along with a dash of white pepper until it fades away. The finish is good, however itâs one of those bourbons that you have to keep going back and sipping if you want to get another dose flavors due to the lightness of it.","There are are a few ways of looking at uniqueness for this Four Roses Super Premium. One group of individuals will say that itâs very unique due to the fact that you can only get it in Japan. Ironically enough, even though this can only be bought in Japan, the text on the front of the bottle is written entirely in English along with half the text on the back. In a weird twist, itâs almost begging to be exported back to the U.S.Another set of individuals will say itâs not that unique and itâs really just another Four Roses blend thatâs slightly different than the Four Roses Yellow or Small Batch variants offered in the U.S. Yes the recipe blend is different than what is sold here, however at the end of the day itâs still made up of a mixture of the various recipes that make up all of the other Four Roses products.Finally there is a third way to look at this, which is where I tend to lean. Yes, much like Blantonâs Special Reserve, just because itâs only sold outside of the U.S., doesnât automatically make it inherently special. Unlike Blantonâs Special Reserve however, this bourbon has legs to stand on. It can hold its own against the other products in the Four Roses line, including while not being an equal peer, the Single Barrel variant. While the bourbon is slightly more sweet than the Four Roses line found in the U.S., the floral and sweet flavor profile isnât so unique that thereâs nothing else on the market like it. If youâre after well balanced floral and sweet, you can just as well find it other bourbons on the market with Blantonâs Single Barrel coming to mind as one example.","At $50 a bottle before taxes in Japan (or shipping & import fees elsewhere in the world), itâs right on target for what this should cost. Sure itâs higher by about $20 than a bottle of Four Roses Small Batch that can be bought in the U.S., however these are two different bourbons that are formulated and priced for two very different markets. That being said, I wouldnât pay a dollar more for this bourbon than its normal price. For one, you can buy a bottle of Four Roses Single Barrel for less which is a different but better bourbon between the two for the price. If you want a bottle and happen to be in Japan, or have a friend who can get you a bottle on their travels, then by all means pay the asking price. However unless youâre a diehard Four Roses fan who wants to add this to your collection, pass on paying anything more for this.",Ongoing,Four Roses Super Premium
84, Straight Bourbon,Kirin Brewery Company,Four Roses,80,NAS, $20 (2017),A floral undertone provides the base for the aromas. Hints of apple and pear lay atop the delicate floral base. A bit of ethanol is present but it doesnât overtake the other scents.,"On the palate this bourbon is soft and lightweight, though it has a nice mouthfeel. Flavors are subtle and well integrated with one another. As a result, it can be described as simply having a fruity, floral essence. The flavors are so well balanced and delicate, itâs nearly impossible to zero in on any one specifically.","Crisp with the fruit and floral characteristics dissipating quickly. A light spice takes their place, and though itâs very soft it lingers pleasantly for some time.","While the flavor profile of Yellow could be considered well balanced and in a sense flawless, it also lacks any characteristics that would make it stand out. Combined with itâs low proof, Yellow is very easy to sip and integrates well into cocktails without overtaking the other ingredients. Based on Yellowâs position in Four Rosesâ standard lineup along with its complicated creation process, itâs safe to assume this is by design with the final product being precisely what the company wants it to be.The creation process for Yellow is not only unique in the industry, but rather intriguing when you consider it relative to the final product. Seeing as how 8 to 10 of the Four Rosesâ unique recipes are blended together to make each Yellow batch, you might expect an onslaught of different flavors. Instead the opposite is true. Of course the various recipes used ultimately provide the base of flavors for the bourbon. However, the use of multiple recipes also serves to mute the unwanted characteristics and imperfections that each individual recipe or barrel might bring to the blend, allowing for meticulous control and consistency from batch to batch.","$20 a bottle for Four Roses Yellow is more than fair as long as expectations are kept in check. Unlike some of the comparably priced Bottled in Bond (BiB) bourbons weâve reviewed, Yellow is 20 proof points lower and generally has a more balanced, yet less exciting flavor profile by comparison, making it more ideal for mixing. Four Rosesâ own Small Batch, the next bottle in their standard portfolio which retails for approximately $10 more than Yellow, is bottled at a higher proof and provides a more interesting flavor profile for those looking to sip neat. Yellow is ideal for anyone who enjoys a more delicate sip or simply wants a mixer that promises not to overpower the drink. While it wonât offend anyone, it probably wonât excite anyone either.",Ongoing,Four Roses Yellow Label
85, Rye,Diageo/George Dickel,"MGP Ingredients, Inc.",90,NAS (Rumored to be around 5 years), $25 (2017),"A very approachable and inviting nose is instantly noticeable. Sweet notes of vanilla, marshmallow, lightly charred wood, fallen leaves, and a hint of grilled peaches. Itâs a different combination, but one that works well. Surprisingly enough, the hints of rye grain that are present, arenât as plentiful as I expected for a whiskey with a 95% rye mashbill.","Any misdirection the nose may have created that this wasnât a high rye is instantly quashed in the palate. My mouth is flooded with a heavy dose of creamy spiced rye grain. The palate has a familiar MGP flavor profile, however itâs clear that the Dickel charcoal filtering process has left its mark. Sweet vanilla and marshmallow follow the rye spice and combine to make for one very enjoyable palate. Itâs not complex, but its delightful creamy profile makes it extremely easy to sip on.","The rye carries through to the finish and is consistent throughout. After a few moments, light hints of white pepper, oak, and leather subtly enter the picture and then subtly exit a few moments later leaving a dry rye characteristic to chew on for several minutes. The finish contains little to no heat and continues on the trend found in the palate of making this extremely easy to drink.","Similar to Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond, I found Dickel Rye to be extremely approachable, but in a slightly different way. Where Rittenhouse is easy to recommend for its ability to help bridge a typical bourbon drinker into the world of rye due to its sweeter characteristics, I feel that Dickel Rye is the next logical evolution as individuals explore the world of ryes. You still have an approachable nose that is unique, yet also inviting to bourbon drinkers. This is followed by a palate and finish that deliver a more traditional rye experience thanks to its 95% rye content. While classic rye characteristics are present in the palate and finish, there is no doubt that the unique Dickel charcoal filtering process has left its mark. The end result is a rye that forgoes exotic flavors and sticks to ones that are straightforward and easy to dissect. The 90 proof is perfectly balanced and allows the flavors to nicely shine through with very little heat being present. This is truly the definition of an easy sipping rye.","Lately it seems to get harder and harder to find an approachable whiskey for under $25. Sure more whiskeys than ever are appearing on the shelf, but many of these are young or sacrifice quality for price. Dickel not only comes in at a reasonable price, but it also delivers a whiskey with a high rye content that isnât seen among its peers at this price point.Much like I found Rittenhouse Rye to be a good value, I feel Dickel Rye falls right in the same camp. It still may not present the spiciest of profiles that hardcore rye drinkers crave, however it delivers an extremely approachable sipping rye, all for $25 or less. Thatâs hard to beat in todayâs market.",Ongoing,George Dickel Rye Whiskey
86, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,128.2,"15 Years, 11 Months", $70 (2013),Initially a sweet taste of caramel hits your tongue that instantly is replaced with a taste of all-spice and leather. The palate hits quick and to the point.,"It's a nice long finish that stays with you for a while. Due to the high proof you might be inclined to say itâs a sharp harsh finish, when in reality thatâs just the alcohol dissipating from your mouth. As it mellows, you get hints of candy corn and rubber, finishing on a note of wet wood and tobacco. It's definitely a strange combination, however it just works in this case.","Being part of the Buffalo Tarce Antique Collection yearly release gives this bourbon a sense of uniqueness to begin with. If you take away the fact that this is a limited edition bourbon that youâre only going to be able to find once a year, youâre still getting a unique 15 year aged barrel proof bourbon that is packed full of flavor.","A $70 bourbon better hold your attention, and thankfully this yearâs edition of Stagg certainly does. For only $20 more than a Stagg Jr. or an Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, you get a premium aged 15 yr old bourbon that embodies the definition of sophisticated bourbon. It's so good, that youâll want to stock up on a couple of bottles to last you the year until the next release.","Another unique factor to this yearâs Stagg is the âlowâ proof. The lowest proof Stagg to date at 128.2 proof, and while many regular Stagg drinkers may be disappointed by the decrease  in proof, I thought the drop made this just as fantastic bourbon in years past. Itâs still the same monster bourbon individuals are used to, however it's in a more manageable proof. This is a bourbon that you want to savor the entire time youâre sipping it and one that youâll want to share with the fellow bourbon lovers in your life.",Fall 2013,George T. Stagg 2013 Release
87, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,138.1,"16 Years, 4 Months", $80 (2014),"Burnt wood, caramel, and a hint of vanilla. There's alcohol with some burn, but it's surprisingly mild on the nose for the proof. I had to inhale more deeply than anticipated to pull out what I did here.","Caramelized wood and burnt brown sugar take the forefront bringing some sweetness into play. Dry wood and leather oppose the sweetness, while a hint of dark chocolate brings everything together. The alcohol creeps up after a moment rather than hitting you right up front, spiking mid-palate with Staggâs well known cinnamon spice. After the spicy kick it dries out quickly getting woody and tannic leading into the finish.","The tannic bitterness transitions back to sweet. Caramel and burnt brown sugar come into play once again. The alcohol burn lingers in the back of your throat, which hides the flavors a little bit in the finish. It warms your chest in a good way, but not as much as expected for the proof. Medium to long finish overall.","Five years ago barrel proof bourbons were less common than today. Because this has become a more popular trend, George T. Stagg has quite a bit more competition when it comes to robust, âstraight-from-the-barrelâ proof monsters. Despite this, Stagg still maintains a unique flavor profile amongst the competition. Maybe a better question is âHow unique is this yearâs Stagg compared with prior years?âTo answer that question, I poured some 2012, 2013, and 2014 for a Stagg vs. Stagg vs. Stagg showdown. The result surprised me. 2012 is almost perfection. Itâs textbook Stagg flavor profile with all the barrel-char robustness you might envision. 2013 stands apart from the others with a more unique profile which I actually picked blind out of the three. Finally our bourbon in review, 2014... unfortunately it takes a backseat to the previous releases in robustness of flavor. Itâs still a top notch bourbon, just not quite as ""wow"" as the past two years when sipped side by side. 2012 dominates as my favorite of the three - a robust and traditional Stagg that is everything you could ever want it to be. 2013 wins out for uniqueness and fullness of flavor, although I prefer the 2012âs profile by comparison. This is just a matter of preference because 2013 is also outstanding - there's quite a nose on it too. 2014 presents a drier, woodier, and less full flavor profile than both of the past two releases making it my least favorite when sipped side by side. Itâs essentially a tamer, oakier version of the 2012 release, which might appeal to some. Keep in mind this was a full-on technical tasting. Sipped on their own itâs more difficult to pick out these nuances and some may prefer 2014âs flavor profile over the past two years.","Like the rest of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection you canât go wrong with Stagg. Itâs a must buy at $80 and even worth paying a little more if you need to. A $10 increase in MSRP over last year seems fair. We estimate around 10,849 bottles will be released this year, which is miniscule considering those bottles need to be shared among everyone worldwide.

88, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Old Heaven Hill Springs Distillery, 94.7,27 Years, $400 (2018),"Woody aromas are most prominent. Seasoned wood, cigar box, and aged oak comprise the overall aroma, along with hints of tobacco. It lacks the typical sweeter notes often found in bourbon, such as caramel and vanilla, but thatâs not to say the woody aroma is overdone. Additionally, the nose notably lacks a general funkiness that is sometimes found in older bourbons, instead highlighting an array of woody scents in a rather straightforward but approachable manner.","Aged wood tannins bite hard. Itâs immediately dry in an unusually upfront way. There are undertones of sweeter characteristics that tease a bit, but donât wholeheartedly come into play. Itâs rather robust, and turns towards a spicy note as its rolled around in the mouth. This robustness is characteristically unusual for such an old and, relatively speaking, low proof bourbon. After repeated sips, Iâm able to get past the initial shock and the wood tannins come off less and less harsh, allowing me to tease out seasoned oak, tobacco, and hints of caramel.","The finish starts with big spice and an in-your-face dryness at first, which then fades to a complex integration of flavors. Lead by aged oak, cigar box, and tobacco, traces of leather and a light smokiness are also present. Itâs anything but smooth at the start, but once the initial bite fades, youâre rewarded with a long and rather complex finish.","Itâs 27 years old, limited production, pre-fire Heaven Hill, and unusually low barrel proofâ¦but you already know that. There are few bourbons brought to market in this age range, and even fewer that are easily comparable. Heaven Hillâs own Parkerâs Heritage 24 Year Bottled In Bond is a good comparison, as is Orphan Barrelâs Old Blowhard. Some of you might also remember Parkerâs Heritage 27 Year, a shocking example of just how good high aged bourbon can be and notably the closest comparable bourbon. Finally, the elusive Pappy Van Winkle, a line of high aged bourbons that, admittedly, succeed in handling their high age quite well (though theyâre not quite as old and have wheat versus rye as the secondary grain in the mashbill).To that end, I will say this. Where the high aged Pappy Van Winkle are sometimes a bit oaky, theyâre also velvety smooth lacking harshness or bitterness and rich in complexity. WhereOrphan Barrelâs Old Blowhard was a bit tannic and arguably over-oaked, it also felt a little watered down and over-filtered, which makes it quite drinkable. Parkerâs Heritage 27 Year is full of rich, aged bourbon flavor, but doesnât overdo it making for one of the best high aged bourbons I've ever had.Parkerâs Heritage 24 Year Bottled In Bond is the most recent similar high aged Heaven Hill release, so I compared it side by side with Heaven Hill 27 Year. Bottled In Bond is more refined and less oaky, though wood flavors still make up much of the flavor profile. The Parkerâs Heritage 24 Year Bottled In Bond is more well rounded and balanced, while the Heaven Hill 27 Year is more robust and wood-forward in its delivery. This characteristic separates Heaven Hill 27 Year from every bourbon I just listed, as itâs the only bourbon over 20 years that Iâve ever had that comes across so brash and unrefined. Taking this as it is, I have to give Heaven Hill credit for not being tempted to over-filter or proof this down. However, the result is a bourbon thatâs quite unusual and raw and tannic in its delivery. Needless to say, itâs not for everyone and takes getting past an initial shock factor to find something to appreciate. Every other bourbon listed here arguably handled its high age more elegantly.","Heaven Hill offers a strong range of value bourbons and whiskeys, which includes their recently retired 6 year old Bottled In Bond Bourbon, Henry McKenna 10 Year, and many more. For limited releases, they tend to price them around $10 per year of aging, with Old Fitzgerald Bottled In Bond and Parkerâs Heritage 24 Year Bottled In Bond being a few recent examples. Heaven Hill 27 Year comes in above that, at $400 which is about $15 per year of aging. But itâs unlikely many who choose to purchase this will consider that a deterrent.The fact is, this is a collectorâs bourbon. Given its age, the uniquely crafted packaging (which notably resembles scotch packaging), and the fact that itâs $400 right out of the gate doesnât even matter. Those who want it will buy it, probably for more than MSRP.For the rest of us, itâs a fun example of what high aged bourbon can taste like, but beyond the initial curiosity phase itâs hardly a bourbon that will be admired for its flavor profile when taking price into consideration. To that end, itâs a poor use of $400.",Fall 2018,Heaven Hill 27 Year Barrel Proof
89, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill ,Heaven Hill,100,7 Years,,"Quintessential aromas of vanilla, caramel, and aged oak come forward. A trace of leather along with even fainter hints of tobacco and honey play in the background. Itâs a little light considering the proof, but well balanced and pleasant overall.","Seasoned oak and spice envelop the taste buds, bursting forth immediately. Savory tobacco and leather notes come next, balanced against graham cracker and butterscotch. It has a lightweight, and somewhat dry mouthfeel. Despite this, the intensity of flavors is just right, inviting you back for more.","Medium to long, cinnamon spice and caramel sweetness find themselves in perfect balance to start it off. Oak mingles in, along with cherries and vanilla sweetness. The dryness present in the palate tapers off, allowing the sweeter notes to echo into the final moments of the finish. Nice overall, and quintessentially bourbon-esque.","Undoubtedly the biggest question is how this new 7 year release compares to its 6 year predecessor. With the same mashbill, proof, Bottled in Bond designation, and the fact that it was released approximately one year after the Kentucky-only 6 year old was discontinued suggests the only difference between the two bottlings is the additional year of aging. Not surprisingly, the 7 year is a tad drier, with a bit more oak pulling away from the sweet and spicy notes more prominent in the 6 year old. But overall, they are marginally different. Each is a quintessential bourbon in every sense of the word, and while enjoyable, unequivocally average.","While the packaging is different, the screw cap has been replaced with a cork, and a year of age has been added, the elephant in the room is this bourbonâs very similar predecessor that retailed for only $12 per bottle. A relic held over from ages past, it was one of the few remaining reminders of a time when bourbon was in far less demand than it is today. Being available only in Kentucky, it was out of reach for many and considered a sort of gift from Heaven Hill to Kentucky, especially considering its ridiculously low price. While I regularly stocked up every opportunity I had, I also frequently brought a bottle to parties, using it to introduce others to bourbon, the concept of Bottled in Bond, and then leaving it for the host to discover later. For the quality relative to price, it was easily bourbonâs best value and having one felt, well, kind of special.At $40 MSRP and what will eventually be, presumably, a nationwide release, the bottle in review is a whole different animal. First and foremost, I want to be clear that I donât harbor any ill-will or resentment about this towards Heaven Hill. $12 for the previous version was undoubtedly a gift, and was sure to come to an end one day. However, with that low price, respectable quality, and Kentucky-only availability somehow made it magical. With the re-release of the 7 year that magic is gone. Instead, itâs a decent flagship bourbon that will appeal to the masses. An approachable quintessential bourbon flavor profile, welcomed age statement, and Bottled in Bond designation all serve to represent Heaven Hill well. While I will likely keep a bottle on hand going forward, unfortunately I wonât get that feeling I once did each time I pour a glass. Sure it adds depth to a collection, but itâs ultimately an average value if not even priced slightly high to accommodate for some inflation in the market. Moreover, at $40 it faces steep competition including the likes of Knob Creek Single Barrel, Eagle Rare 10 Year, and for much less, Wild Turkey 101.",,Heaven Hill 7 Year Bottled in Bond
90, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,100,6 Years, $12 (2017),"Notes of honey, vanilla, corn, and oak are the main draw, while fainter hints of citrus, brown sugar, and leather linger in the background. Itâs very hard to dislike this nose as itâs filled with sweet and agreeable flavors. Overall a nice quality to the scents, but a bit surprising how weak they come across considering the proof.","A somewhat shocking amount of oak at the forefront tends to overshadow the other flavors entirely. Butterscotch, rye spice, and a tad of mint fight for attention. The bourbon is on the thin side, but not as detrimental as you would expect. Itâs smooth and has a lightweight consistency. It may flirt with being too familiar and simply average, yet itâs all-too-easy to come back for more.","A warming burn comes across on the medium length finish thatâs dominated by oak notes. Cinnamon spice lingers, which is offset by sweet caramel notes, but neither gains much attention over the oak. Enjoyable finish, just not that exciting.","The bourbon itself is an average affair. It wonât surprise you, nor challenge you, yet itâs extremely easy to drink and enjoy. Itâs hard to find any crippling faults with it besides its mild impact. Mainly this will serve as an everyday drinker or a table bourbon as whiskey writer Lew Bryson calls them. I have a hard time believing anyone would honestly dislike this bourbon if they enjoy drinking whiskey. But will they love and remember it? Probably not for itâs flavor, but maybe for itâs price.","Tasting this blind, I would expect the majority of people to incorrectly guess its MSRP. Too many have spent their formative years drinking way-to-cheap vodka and rum to have any amount of respect for a similar priced whiskey. Many bourbon consumers have been conditioned to exclude anything on the bottom shelf at a store, which generally falls in the $15 or less category. The fact that this can still be bought for under $15 with a 6 year age statement, and be of decent quality will shock even a seasoned whiskey drinker. Sure the whiskey itself is a tad thin and the flavors arenât as pronounced as much as one would like, but at 100 proof and with almost no alcohol notes for a bourbon this inexpensive, you really have to try hard to find something to dislike with this whiskey.",Ongoing (Limited),Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond
91, Straight Bourbon Finished in Cognac Barrels,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,124.4,8 year old bourbon finished in a cognac barrel for 21 months, $150 (2016),"The additional cognac barrel aging is evident right from the start. Rich is the best way to describe this nose. Toasted sugar, vanilla, creme brulee, dark berries, spiced raisins, and aged oak lightly dance out of the glass. For a 124.4 proof bourbon, Iâm surprised how extremely little alcohol is present. This allows the bourbon to come across as more mellow with rich undertones that are clearly influenced by the additional time the bourbon spent in the cognac barrel, and makes me excited to take a sip each time. The rich scents become more prominent with additional exposure to air.","This is where the influence of the cognac barrel seems most evident. Plump juicy raisins that have been soaked in syrup, dark berries, a bit of grain, aged oak, and hints of toasted sugar and light caramel all nicely play together. Much like the nose, the palate comes across as mellow and refined, however it also tends to lean slightly to the dry side, though this shouldnât be interpreted as a fault by any means. Additionally thereâs a bit of heat in the palate, but nothing so unmanageable that you canât swirl this around the inside of your mouth to pick out the flavors and enjoy.","Aged oak is a consistent flavor throughout and the finish is no exception to this. Oak is the driving flavor in this finish, but I also find it contains gratifying hints of leather, pepper, raisins, and dark dry chocolate. It lingers for a while with a warming oaky dry aftertaste being present. This finishes older than its age and if you had me taste this blind I would have guessed this to be more of a 14-16 year old bourbon. Itâs not bad by any means, however it doesnât quite shine as brightly as the palate.","From a high level view, the individual components of Select Stock arenât groundbreaking by any means. For starters, you can buy a wheated barrel proof bourbon any time you wish thanks to Makerâs Mark Cask Strength or by visiting the Makerâs Mark gift shop for Maker's 46 Cask Strength, and letâs not forget the hard to get your hands on William Larue Weller. Additionally, barrel finished bourbons and whiskeys in general are becoming more and more commonplace and run the gamut of the various alcohol barrel types the whiskey is finished in, including Angelâs Envy Finished Rye, 1792 Port Finish, Barrell Whiskey Batch 002, and High Westâs Yippee Ki-Yay to name a few. Even the type of finish, in this case a cognac barrel, isnât new as Heaven Hillâs Parkerâs Heritage Collection 5th edition was a rye based bourbon finished in cognac barrels and Belle Meade produces a cognac finished bourbon too. Finally, the age of the bourbon certainly isnât unique nor is the amount of time it was barrel finished.However, the magic with this bourbon is when you combine all of its individual components together. A wheated barrel proof bourbon that has been barrel finished in a cognac barrel for 21 months is certainly unique. Not only that but the flavor profile it offers is delicious. Itâs a great bourbon that makes you want to pair it with a rich creme brulee or a nice dish of rich handmade vanilla ice cream to help complement it. Iâm looking forward to taking on the hard job of experimenting to find out what desserts this pairs best with in the future.","Value is something thatâs always hard to rate, as the value lies in the eye of the beholder. To some, paying a premium for a unique barrel finished whiskey that also happens to be a barrel proof wheater is well worth the price of admission. To others, anything over $100 needs to blow them out of the water to justify the price. As tasty and unique as this bourbon is, at $150, this personally gives me pause. Yes the bourbon is quite delicious, and I would definitely like to have another in my collection, however I would also like to see this sold for about $50 less.For those interested in trying a barrel finished whiskey, you can find examples in the market that are good and unique for a lot less. 1792 Port Finish and Angelâs Envy Finished Rye are two that immediately come to mind, and both sell for significantly less.

While I will give some credit for uniqueness based on the fact that itâs a 10 year age stated BiB single barrel bourbon, I cannot say that those traits result in a unique flavor profile and as a result, carry less weight for me in this category than they might otherwise. But alas, the lack of a unique flavor profile is not always a bad thing, as a quintessential bourbon flavor profile is sometimes just what the doctor ordered.","With age statements dropping in waves from everyday bourbons, including the recent loss of Elijah Craig Small Batchâs 12 year age statement, McKennaâs front and center 10 year age statement sitting amongst other $30 bourbons now seems to stand out like never before. While a higher age does not necessarily equate to a better bourbon, it does signify a milestone that must be attained before the barrel can be selected and bottled. Itâs a hard line, and younger âready enoughâ bourbon cannot simply be substituted to increase production, presumably compromising quality or desired flavor profile as corporate pressures compete with the skillful selection of barrels in the rickhouse. In addition, single barrel bourbons are generally considered to be drawn from the honey barrels as they must be taken as is; distillers do not have the option to blend them into other barrels to achieve the desired end result. Finally, being BiB results in a bottling proof of 100 which some consider an ideal proof and one that is higher than many other bourbons on the shelf for around $30. When it comes to the technicals there are close comparisons at this price point, but none of them carry the combination of a 10 year age statement, single barrel, and BiB.While all this makes McKenna look like the class Valedictorian on paper, the question of value then becomes a subjective question of taste. Henry McKenna closely resembles the limited edition 2013 Parkerâs Heritage Collection âPromise of Hopeâ single barrel bourbon in mash bill, proof, age, and style. While not of the same caliber, my strong affinity for Parkerâs Promise of Hope makes me admittedly partial to McKennaâs flavor profile as they share the same traditional, quintessential no gimmicks characteristics.Iâve sampled from three different McKenna barrels and while Iâve found them all to be in within the same range, I will say one was a little better than the other two. A function of single barrel selection no doubt, I still feel each was a great value for the price. Coupled with the technicals this is very simply a great deal for around $30. Unfortunately, McKennaâs relative value now seems so obvious that I can only assume it might be one of the next on the chopping block. Either the age statement will drop, or the price will pop.",Ongoing,Henry McKenna Single Barrel
93, Light Whiskey,High West,Sourced (from MGP formerly LDI),92,14 Years, $100,"While not deep, the nose is inviting. If youâre a vanilla fan, youâre in for a treat as the nose is predominantly made up of heavy doses of vanilla. Lightly layered under the vanilla are traces of sweet caramel and touches of honey; all of which are trailed by a clear ethanol undertone. The ethanol doesnât take away from the nose by any means, but it also makes its presence known with each deep inhale I take.","The nose set me up for a palate I wasnât ready for. I assumed I was about to encounter a pretty one-dimensional palate. Instead, Iâm blown away by what greets me. A lush palate full of light chocolate, berries, sweet frozen grapes, and honey are all entwined by rich vanilla. It sounds like a weird combination, but all of the sweet flavors play nicely together and form a delicious palate overall.Where the ethanol made itself known in the nose, the palate contains very little heat and Iâm able to roll the whiskey around my mouth thanks in part to the fact that there's almost no burn. The palate consists of a great viscosity that, while not super heavy, is a nice weight that coats your mouth perfectly. Really unexpected and well done.","The vanilla continues to shine through the finish and is the predominant trait once again. Iâm also greeted with ever so faint hints of caramel and oak and the fleeing ghosts of sugary fruits found in the palate. The finish lingers for a while with an enjoyable vanilla flavor that slowly fades away well after I take a sip, yet it doesnât hold a candle to the palate that preceded it.","I give High West credit for releasing a light whiskey to the market. I have to admit that up until this release, I hadnât had a chance to try a light whiskey before and didnât know too much about the concept. This isnât for lack of trying, rather the fact that no major American Whiskey distiller that I know of regularly produces a light whiskey and bottles it as such for consumer purchase. If youâre interested in more of the backstory about how light whiskey came to be in the U.S., Chuck Cowdery did a great in-depth write-up.Additionally, the entire time I was tasting this whiskey, I forgot that I was drinking a 14 year old whiskey. The whiskey is so light and vibrant in taste that Iâd bet good money if I had someone blind taste test this, they would peg it for a whiskey at least half its age. Itâs amazing that itâs spent so much time in the wood, but doesnât taste at all woody. This whiskey is one thatâs really interesting and unlike anything Iâve experienced with a whiskey aged this long.","The going rate for special distillery-only High West releases tends to be $100 or more, and once again High West hits this target for their 14 Year Old Light Whiskey. On the one hand youâre paying for the ability to try a type of whiskey that you normally donât come across everyday in the American marketplace. On the other hand, this whiskey, while tasty, isnât very deep outside of the palate, and might let down those who are looking for a deeper tasting experience for the money.When compared to other one-time cheaper limited releases on the market, such as Barrell Bourbonâs excellent Batch 005 or 006, 14 Year Old Light Whiskey just doesnât stack up in flavor or in price. I can see this being more of an impulse buy for people who are touring the distillery and want to take home something special that they canât find in the marketplace. Just realize that if you do find yourself in this situation, youâre paying a high price to try a type of whiskey that normally isnât produced to sell to consumers and while enjoyable, is generally basic outside of the palate for the high price of admission.",April 2016,High West 14 Year Old Light Whiskey
94, Rye,High West,Sourced (6 year from LDI now MGP and 16 year from Barton Distillery),98.6,Blend of 6 & 16 year of rye whiskeys, $90,"The smell of rich red wine is at the forefront. Raspberries and a hint of rye spice also pull through. Is there a hint of baking fruit pie in there? I want to say it reminds me of the smell of some kind of dessert freshly baking, I just canât put my finger on it. One thing is certain though, itâs definitely a blend of red wine and whiskey on the nose, with the red wine dominating.","Dark fruit is prominent, cherries and raspberries specifically. It coats the mouth and tongue nicely giving a rich, velvety mouthfeel. Thereâs less spice than with the standard Rendezvous Rye, but about the same level of complexity. Like the smell, the taste is blend of dark red wine and whiskey although the whiskey dominates on the palate.","No new flavors make themselves present. Fades away softly. Medium length and not very spicy, but warming none-the-less.","Barrel finished whiskey is becoming more and more popular. It adds a flair of excitement and separation from the masses. âLook at all those ryesâ¦ but wait, this one is barrel finished!â Although different, barrel finished does not necessarily mean good. Itâs the equivalent of adding some flavoring to our whiskey, just in a more romantic way than simply measuring and dumping. That said, A Midwinter Nights Dram is a barrel finished success. High West starts with the standard Rendezvous Rye and manages to impart some deep fruity flavors from the port wine barrel finishing that tames the spice and gives this a thick, velvety mouthfeel. High West claims this âtastes like the flavors of Christmas,â which Iâd say isnât a very far stretch. It definitely seems like something I could see myself sipping around a fire in the presence of family and friends. Even itâs reddish hue alludes to a Christmas theme.","The value delivered by this whiskey is that fact that itâs been blended and finished so elegantly. As mentioned before in some ways there is nothing else quite like it, so that can dictate a higher price. Compared with the High West's Rendezvous Rye at $50, this is quite a bit more expensive. There is additional cost to age it longer though, which must be considered. This is also a fairly limited release and we donât really know how much more will be released in the future, if any. For those reasons, this is worth getting your hands on a bottle to try and I think itâs priced fairly. I would definitely buy again when this bottle runs out, although I think that may be a while.",October 2014,High West A Midwinter Nights Dram Act 2.1
95, Bourbon / Rye Blend,High West,Sourced from MGP/LDI/Seagrams Indiana and Barton Distillery,92,NAS - See notes below, $80 (2015),"The nose can best be summed up as organic: dew covered grass, fresh oak, and light evergreen are all present. Thereâs very little alcohol presence thatâs noticeable sans a slight tingling at the end of each whiff. Itâs not bad, but for such a complex mingling of whiskeyâs, itâs not at all memorable either.","For a blend of bourbon and ryes of varying age I was expecting a complex palate. Instead Iâm greeted with something that while enjoyable, is pretty straightforward and plain. The palate is a solid balanced mix of sweet and spicy. The honey and vanilla from the bourbon blend nicely with the peppery heat from the rye. Unfortunately these flavors dominate the whole palate and leave no room for the possibility of any subtle flavors to come through.","While the palate is simple and straightforward, the finish is slightly more complex. Leather and wood are present upfront and stay with you throughout the length of the finish. Additionally a high heat stays on my tongue from the beginning through the middle of the finish and then abruptly stops. Itâs a shame since I was hoping the finish would morph into something more than it did versus the sudden drop off thatâs experienced instead.","There arenât too many bourbon-rye blends on the market outside of what High West is putting out with Bourye and Son of Bourye, with only Wild Turkeyâs Forgiven & Jeffersonâs Chef Collaboration coming to mind. Compared to Son of Bourye, Bouryeâs palate pops more with the intensity of the sweet and spicy profile being much bolder. The finish is also slightly more complex and the added high heat is a nice touch in comparison. That being said, itâs still a simple flavor profile overall for such a complex blended whiskey.While the flavor profile isnât one that will blow you away, credit should be given to High West for bringing a product like this to the market. In an industry thatâs focused on experimenting with different grains and barrel finishes, itâs nice to see some innovation on the blending side of things. Many distilleries blend their ryes or bourbons when creating a batch of whiskey, in fact this is true for all whiskeys sans single barrel products, however blending together a bourbon with different rye recipes from multiple distilleries and different high ages is not very common. Innovation on the blending front is a breath of fresh air, and I wish other distilleries would try something similar in the future.","While whiskey pricing across the board has been increasing steadily over the past few years, $80 is still considered a premium priced whiskey in the marketplace today. High West chose to use high aged distillates in Bourye when they easily could have gone the route of using lower aged, inexpensive whiskeys and created the same simple flavor profile. Unfortunately, they're trying to charge a price that they feel is in line with the various ryes and bourbon they used while producing a product thatâs hard to justify as premium.Bourye is double the price of High West's other multi-style-whiskey blend Son of Bourye, with only marginal improvement over it. Realistically Bourye is more along the line of a $40 whiskey, and this is only to fairly compensate High West for the additional cost of the higher aged whiskeys they use in the blend. At $80 a bottle, and the highest priced bottle of common bourbon-rye blends on the market, I would expect a more complex flavor profile that would justify the price. Instead youâre presented with an overly simple, straightforward flavor profile with Bourye.",January 2015,High West Bourye 2015 Release
96, Blend of Straight Rye Whiskeys,High West Distillery,Sourced,92,Blend of 2 rye whiskeys, $35 (2017),"Rye spice, apple cinnamon, brewed apple cider, and mint.","The nose speaks truth as the smell becomes a reality on the palate. Botanicals, anise, and something almost gin-like emerge making this one of the most unique tasting ryes Iâve ever had. Itâs definitely got the spice of a rye, but thereâs little burn. This is one of the most important elements because it lets the true flavors come forward without that layer of alcohol hiding anything. Spice without burn: amazing.","Longer lingering with plenty of spice, but still very little burn. A great finish to a truly unique whiskey.","This is in a class of its own, with little similarities to anything else Iâve had. Although I really enjoy it, itâs so unique that I canât predict whether or not everyone will find it as appealing as I do. Some may even downright hate it even if they can appreciate its uniqueness simply because the flavors are not to their liking. Despite that, this should go on everyoneâs list as a must try.","This jumps off the charts at $35 making it worth hunting down even if just to give it a try. Although High West does not disclose the breakdown of its ingredients, you can be satisfied knowing youâre getting at least some of the refinement brought to you by its 16 year old ingredient. I would take this over a $70 bottle of WhistlePig any day of the week. This is a must buy and could sell for double the price if High West wanted. ",Ongoing,High West Double Rye
97, Blend of Straight Rye Whiskeys,High West,Sourced (2 year from LDI now MGP and 16 year from Barton Distillery),100,Blend of 2 & 16 year rye whiskey, $50 (2014),"It still has the rye backbone of the Double Rye, but the barrel finish introduces layers of smoke, leather, fruit, floral scents, and pine to its nose. Itâs interesting how much the rye scent takes a backseat to the more powerful aromas of the campfire whiskey. This might be a tell-tale sign of how much influence this additional barrel finish had on the Double Rye as a whole.","This is quite the assemblage of flavors. At first sip, all of the flavors can be overwhelming. There is a lot going on with the palate of this whiskey. After a few sips you can start to pick out each of the flavors. That great Double Rye flavor again creates the backbone of the palate. Then more of the whiskey flavors of nutmeg, tobacco, vanilla and toffee mingle in. The unique scotchy and smokey Campfire Whiskey flavor rounds out the palate.","Despite being eight proof points higher than the standard Double Ryeblend, this is an incredibly smooth bourbon at 100 proof. For fans of a hot finish, this almost has none. At the same time though, it really allows you the chance to dissect all of the layers of flavor and youâll need it. A lot of the palateâs flavors blend together on the way down and in a way, cancel each other out. On the plus side, the aftertaste of this whiskey is dominated by a fried dough/funnel cake notes. Yum.","On paper, this whiskey reads like a science experiment or something your kid came up with at the dinner table. Despite appearing like itâs the kitchen-sink style approach to whiskey blending/finishing, the end result is far from a trainwreck. Iâve never been a fan of any barrel finished whiskey as they always seem like theyâre less like whiskey and more like something else entirely. Surprisingly, I found this Double Rye - Campfire Finish very interesting and very drinkable. Thereâs nothing else out on the American whiskey market that tastes like it.","At a $15 premium over the standard MSRP of High Westâs Double Rye, this is a great price for this unique whiskey. Most premium whiskeys, which often have very unique traits, are priced a lot higher than $50. High Westâs own A Midwinter Nights Dram is priced in the $80-$90 range and when it comes down to it, Iâd grab this Double Rye Campfire finish over it because of the drastic price difference. To put it in perspective: you're getting the fantastic High West Double Rye as the base of this whiskey that is then capped off with a very drinkable, one-of-a-kind finish, for $50.",October 2014,High West Double Rye Campfire Finish
98, Blend of Straight Rye Whiskeys,High West,Sourced (2 year from LDI now MGP and 16 year from Barton Distillery),104.8,Blend of 2 & 16 year rye whiskey, $53 (2015),"If youâre looking for a classic rye profile on the nose, youâve come to the wrong place. That being said, youâre still greeted with a great nose. On first pass it smells as if someone made a Manhattan versus pouring rye whiskey into my glass. Iâm immediately hit with the smells of Maraschino cherries, sweet vermouth, and a healthy dose of alcohol vapors which you normally donât find in the standard High West Double Rye. Lingering longer I notice hints of angostura bitters, field grass, light oak, and then finally your typical Double Rye.","The influence of the extra aging in the Manhattan barrels is immediately evident in full force on the palate. The standard profile and spice of the Double Rye takes a back seat on this bottle. On first sip, Iâm immediately greeted with an immensely sweet rye, with Maraschino cherries that have been soaked in a lightly spiced rye. Hiding behind the Maraschino cherries is a slight hint of licorice along with sweet vanilla and a noticeable amount of oak. Itâs not a super deep palate, however what it does contain, it highlights nicely. This is such a radical change from the standard Double Rye that you would be hard-pressed to realize it started as the same base whiskey if you were to do a blind side-by-side comparison.","The typical rye flavor profile missing in the nose and palate makes itself known in this long finish. While the taste of cherries continues to pull through, I am mainly greeted with classic rye spice flavors. Additionally, the finish has a pleasant low heat that lingers for quite some time allowing me to enjoy it for several minutes after each sip. To me this will be perfect to sip on and enjoy when you just want to take a quiet moment to relax and enjoy nothing more than contemplating a nice, complex glass of whiskey.","This is one of the more unique barrel-finished whiskeys Iâve had. Iâm not sure if itâs best to describe it as an over-proofed Manhattan or an over-sweetened Double Rye. Either way, the flavor profile is one I havenât found in any other product on the market. Additionally, at 104.8 proof youâre getting a chance to taste a higher proof High West whiskey which is not very common. It makes me wish that theyâd release more of their whiskeys at higher proofs because with the exception of the nose, the flavors really pop without imparting too much alcohol on the flavor profile. Itâs interesting to note that the standard Double Rye also pops without much alcohol in the profile, which might be evidence that this is the reason for it as opposed to the barrel-finishing.","At only a $15 premium over the MSRP of the standard High West Double Rye, this is a great price for this unique whiskey. Itâs right in line with the pricing you usually see for other barrel-finished High West whiskeys. To put this in comparison, High Westâs own barrel-finished Manhattan, â36th Vote Barreled Manhattan,â retails for $45. While that product offers you a nice premade Manhattan, with this bottling youâre able to get a bold, higher than average proof High West product that brings with it a unique Manhattan inspired flavor profile. A fantastic offering for the price.",November 2015,High West Double Rye Manhattan Finish
99, Blend of Straight Rye Whiskeys,High West Distillery,Sourced,92,Blend of 2 rye whiskeys, $55 (2017),"Pleasant and sweet - caramel, honey, and vanilla mingle together with little nostril burn.","The nose didnât lie, the elements detected there are also present on the palate. Burnt brown sugar also enters, further sweetening the sip. A good dose of rye spice is balanced by the other elements, including a little bit of burnt wood. Full-flavored and complex.","Wood becomes more evident, a testament to the 16 year old rye within the mix. After a seemingly sudden finish, a delicate amount of burnt sugar and wood still linger for a while. At first I thought this was an abrupt finish, but it turns out its just so full flavored on the palate that I wasnât noticing the flavors still present long after the sip.","The large amount of rye in the mashbills combined with a 16 year old ingredient are likely what give this its wonderful balance of spicy and sweet. Although the basic flavor elements could be described as traditional, itâs the balance that makes the Rendezvous stand out. Because this is a blend of two whiskeys that were sourced by High West, this will likely sell out eventually, at which point there wonât be anything quite like it out there.","Upon first sip it is evident that youâre drinking a top notch whiskey that could stand up against those with both greater age and a higher sticker price. Ryes are tricky too, because they have a sweet spot in the 6-8 year old range. With the Rendezvous, we seem to get the best of both worlds with a balance of youthful and refined elements coming together in a truly premium whiskey.",Ongoing,High West Rendezvous Rye
100, Straight Rye,High West,Barton & LDI (Seagram's now MGP),92,16 Years, $125 (2015),"It opens with inviting notes of baking spices and a bit of fresh fruit. It almost smells youthful at first but not in the typical harsh way. With a few minutes in the glass the nose progresses to warmer and more developed notes of caramel, honey, gingerbread, and oak, along with fainter hints of orange and lemon. Itâs not overly complex, nor overly oaked, which is a surprise from a blend of 16 year and 17 year old ryes. Overall a really nice opening.","Many of the notes from the nose carry over to the palate. Baking spices, gingerbread, vanilla, and caramel easily stick out the most. Like many of High Westâs rye blends, the palate isnât incredibly complex. It definitely tastes sweeter than some of their other offerings and that might be the whiskeyâs main sticking point. The spice, while present, is dialed back and mingles with the sweet notes differently than most rye whiskeys. All of this makes for a very approachable whiskey.","Except for a slight trace of a semi-dry oaky aftertaste, Iâm surprised at how fast the finish drops off and leaves almost no flavor on the tongue. Itâs almost like a magic trick: there one second, gone the next. The whiskey has a nice mouthfeel and some weight to it as it begins to go down, but then immediately thins out once it does. Despite all of this sounding negative, I wouldnât call the finish necessarily bad. I just wish the flavors stuck around longer. Thankfully it leaves just the right amount on burn on the way down to remind you that it was there.","High aged ryes are a rarity. One of the main reasons is because ryes generally taste better under the 10 year mark. Of course there are exceptions to this, namely Sazerac 18 Year, Willett Family Estate ryes, Rittenhouse 21-25 years, and even High Westâs other high aged ryes. Hearing over and over from master distillers how difficult it is to properly age bourbon for a high number of years, aging rye for the same number of years might be even harder since there are so few available. Any time a high age rye hits the market, itâs reason enough to take notice.High West has yet again turned to what they do best: blending. Where some of the companyâs other ryes are blends of young and old, this edition of Rocky Mountain Rye is a blend of 16-year-old Barton rye and a 17-year-old LDI rye. Blending young and old ryes makes a lot of sense as it helps smooth out the highs and lows that rye often has. However, many high-aged ryes are often heavily oaked, so blending only high aged ryes with a good results must be a trial of tribulations.Rocky Mountain Rye 16 Year shares a lot of similarities to High Westâs last high aged rye, Rocky Mountain Rye 21 Year. Mainly, both keep their oak notes in check and are both very smooth drinkers. The 16 Year is also sweeter than most ryes, which makes for an interesting interplay with the rye spice. Many people donât like to drink rye whiskey because they often describe it as harsh or too spicy. Someone would be hard pressed to describe Rocky Mountain Rye 16 Year in that regard. For what it is, this edition of Rocky Mountain Rye is unique enough in its own right much like the the two in the series before it.","At $125 and only available at the distillery, this whiskey really has to prove itself for someone to make a special trip for this bottle. Blending two high aged ryes together is a rarity and the overall flavor profile is above-average, but any bourbon or rye priced above $100 these days is going to be looked over with a magnifying glass by discerning whiskey enthusiasts. Despite a market that will support high-priced whiskey, the real question for true enthusiasts is: âIs it worth its asking price?âThat answer of course depends on what youâre looking for. Even in a world where Rittenhouse 21-25 Year is long gone, Sazerac 18 and Van Winkle Family Reserve have become unicorn whiskeys and Willettâs Family Estate Rye bottles are dying out, $125 may still be too expensive for this whiskey. Yes, itâs a tasty rye that is on the sweeter side and has a perfect amount of oak notes, but itâs just not at the same level as other high end ryes. Again itâs a very enjoyable whiskey, but thereâs nothing about itâs flavor profile jumps and screams âclassic.â That said, the price is still within the realm (even below) of current [ultra] limited edition releases. With an estimated 1,300 bottles being released, High West could have easily charged double for this and many on the secondary market will ask that or even much more. Essentially, donât hate the player; hate the game.","September 7, 2015",High West Rocky Mountain Rye 16 Year

Vanilla, caramel, very light spice, cinnamon, and brown sugar all come together wrapped up in a candy coating.",Medium length but with a resonating sweetness.,"This is not technically a rye because it was aged in used barrels. To stay legal, they call it âWhiskey Distilled From Rye Mash Stored 21 Years in Reused Cooperage,â which makes it more interesting to me. I couldnât find anything definitive about what the barrels had been used for before this, but it is doubtful it was anything too far off from a bourbon or rye because there arenât any noticeable additional flavors. If it was wine or rum I think it would be more evident. The most notable thing about this whiskey is how smooth it is. Combine this with its complexity and good flavor do make it unique in a sense. As a comparison, Barterhouse is incredibly smooth, but it almost tastes like they added too much water to proof it down. The Rocky Mountain Rye could easily go unnoticed as special by anyone not paying attention to the subtleties it offers. However, there is something good going on here.","Itâs 21 years old and there were only 75 barrels total. This certainly makes it seem special. At an original price of $130 and upwards of $200 or more if youâre lucky enough to locate a bottle today you would expect something special. Itâs certainly high quality, goes down easy (maybe a little too easy), and itâs very enjoyable. I doubt youâd find any whiskey drinker that could say they donât like this. Unfortunately it seems to be missing the X-factor. It just doesnât have that hard-to-describe element that makes it really stand out. Because of this, I think itâs overpriced for what youâre getting. Itâs delicious, no doubt, but the age and scarcity dictate the price in this case.

The influence of the Oloroso Sherry casks is quite evident, with notes of sweet dark fruits taking the forefront. Most prominent are cherries, candied raisins, and a bit of something else sweet, dried apricots maybe. Underneath I notice more typical bourbon flavors - vanilla, caramel, rye spice, burnt brown sugar, and just a tiny bit of seasoned oak. It has a bit of an herbal/floral quality to it as well. Rolling it around in my mouth I notice other subtle elements that I canât quite put my finger on.","Crisp and clean, with a bit of rye spice popping at the onset.

You might wonder how they got around the strict requirements to label this bourbon, as bourbon has to be aged in new charred oak containers, among other requirements. Unless theyâve figured out a more creative workaround, the new distillate would have to enter new charred oak barrels first, however since this is not labelled âstraight bourbonâ the time spent in these barrels could be relatively short. From there the process gets even more complicated; according to a Whisky Advocate post, Hillrock uses seven different barrel sizes, and as for the the source of the older stock - âdonât bother asking; they werenât talking.âWhen a unique curation process is involved I always hope for a unique flavor profile. Hillrock delivers one here, albeit in a very subtle way. Iâve read a range of other reviews of this bourbon and it seems that its flavor profile has been a mutation since first released in 2012. Because the solera blend changes over time, the average age and underlying flavor characteristics of the blend change as well. Presumably, the percentage of older sourced bourbon has diminished over time, being replaced with a higher percentage of Hillrockâs farm-to-bottle distillate unless additional sourced bourbon has been re-introduced at some point (which is unknown).Over time, the solera process is intended to yield a consistent final product, marrying the characteristics of young and old while also diminishing the impact of the occasional batch that doesnât quite fit the desired flavor profile... all while asymptotically converging on a higher average age. In other words, if they stick to the same solera aging process long enough, though the average age continues to increase, these incremental increases eventually become so small that they reach a point where the change in average age is relatively insignificant from batch to batch. Because the average age cannot be measured precisely it has to be estimated, with Hillrock estimating theirs at around six years (currently).","Iâve gazed longingly at this bourbon on the liquor store shelf for a few years now. Iâve picked up the beautifully heavy bottle and felt its weight in my hands, contemplating the nearly one hundred dollars I would have to trade to make it my own. But Iâve always returned it to the shelf. Something about an always available, potentially disappointing craft bourbon at this price, even with its unique aging process, has kept me from physically carrying it up to the cash register and doing the deed. The bottle in review: A Christmas gift.Fortunately it hasnât disappointed me. Much like my experience with Sazerac 18 Year Rye, Iâve found this whiskey to be one that requires a bit of focus when sipping along with a more experienced palate to fully appreciate. Itâs delicate, layered, and quite subtle in its delivery. As a result, itâs one of those whiskeys whose wonderful subtleties might be easily drowned out within a flight of more robust whiskeys or alongside a spread of food. Moreover, this shouldnât be one of your first purchases - Iâd suggest experiencing a wide range of other bourbons before forking over almost a Benjamin for this one.Because this bourbon is so expensive, itâs also easily obtainable. Hillrock operates on a small scale with what seems to be a focus on quality versus quantity and the process of solera aging is certainly more involved than a typical aging process. Whatever theyâre doing must be working, because while I plan to consume this sparingly, for me it passes the ultimate test - when this bottle is finished, Iâll be buying another.",Ongoing,Hillrock Estate Solera Aged  Bourbon
104, Straight Bourbon,Diageo/I.W. Harper Distilling Co.,Sourced,82,NAS, $35 (2017),"The nose is light and airy without a lot of standout flavors, which is to be expected from such a low proof bourbon. Traces of light vanilla, corn, fresh cork, and new oak are all present. The nose comes across as really young and makes me think that theyâre using a bourbon not a day older than 4 years old, which is the bare minimum to be labeled straight bourbon without an age statement. Not a hint of alcohol is found on the nose which isnât surprising for an 82 proof bourbon.","Taking my first sip, I immediately notice how sweet of a flavor profile Diageo imparted on the reincarnation of this brand. Honey, elderflower, vanilla, and toasted sugar are noticeable upfront. Additionally I notice that slight corky-ness that was on the nose in the palate too.The palate isnât bad per se, however itâs just not very complex. I would really like to see what this bourbon tastes like at a 100 proof or higher since I feel a lot more complexity would be revealed. Again the seemingly youngness of this bourbon comes to mind when tasting it.","Much like the palate, the finish lacks in complexity. Iâm immediately hit with a big burst of juicy Georgia peaches upfront thatâs mixed with lightly dried raisins and vanilla. The finish ends on a very short light leather and oak note. The shortness of this finish is something that really surprised me. While I really like the immediate taste of peaches, the flavor only lasts for a few seconds before morphing into the leather and oak, and peters out altogether within about 30 seconds. I do wish it would have lasted a little longer, because itâs pretty tasty for the moments when itâs present.","The rich history of Isaac Wolfe Bernheim and the Bernheim Brothers distillery is fascinating to read about, and I.W. Harper is an iconic brand in the sense of its longevity. While it hasnât been sold in the US for almost 20 years, the brand has lived on globally in its domestic absence. Itâs neat to see a brand thatâs been around for over a 140 years being sold again in the US.All this makes for a nice unique backstory, however sadly it doesnât make for a nice unique tasting bourbon. When bringing this brand back to the domestic market, Diageo is relying on the iconic I.W. Harper name instead of focusing on the bourbon in the bottle. Nothing special is currently found in the production, sourcing, and bottling of this bourbon besides Diageo marketing the Stitzel-Weller Distillery name where this bourbon was aged.","If I had tasted this blind and you told me that the bourbon I was tasting was $35, I would have assumed it was from an upstart distiller due to how young it tastes and the price. It really reminds me of bourbons aged two years or less that Iâve had from upstart distillers like 2Bar or OYO.Knowing that itâs actually a mass scale bourbon, Iâm surprised and disappointed that Diageo is trying to command the price point itâs set at. While it has a flavor profile that will easily appeal to first time bourbon drinkers, this is realistically a $20 bourbon at most. Itâs not bad, but itâs nothing special. There are many other bourbons such as Four Roses Small Batch, Elijah Craig 12 Year, and Buffalo Trace at or below the $30-$35 price point that I would recommend before recommending this NAS I.W Harper.",March 2015 / Ongoing,I.W.

105, Straight Bourbon,Diageo/I.W. Harper Distilling Co.,New Bernheim Distillery,86,15 Years, $75 (2016),"Bright and enjoyable thanks to an abundance of fruit notes. Cherry and apricot are the most striking, with orange and lemon coming across a bit fainter. Mint and dark chocolate inhabit deeper layers that become more apparent as the fruit scents dissipate. Swirling the bourbon in the glass stimulates the aromas much more so than Iâve noted in other bourbons. This is evenly layered for a 15 year old bourbon, and one thatâs hard to find obvious flaws in.","Not quite the striking fruit-forward palate that the nose lead me to believe, but fruit is still very much present. The milder fruit flavors dissipate and give way to heavier notes of oak and leather. Chocolate and caramel also pop up and help provide a nice balance between the sweet and dry notes. Itâs smooth creamy mouthfeel helps the sweeter flavors coat your mouth until the finish kicks in.",It begins with a manageable amount of heat that soon gives way to an oaky underbelly. The bourbonâs mouthfeel helps the palateâs flavors slowly pull back one by one as the finish slowly fades. New notes of vanilla and caramel become more noticeable and a mild oaky aftertaste lingers on the finish. This combination provides a gratifying sweet and dry ending.,"The first time I had I.W. Harper 15 Year, all I could notice was its fruit flavors and it immediately brought to mind Barterhouse, another Diageo product I enjoy. After having it a few more times, I began to notice its oak side much more. The two bourbons share many similarities, mainly their modest oak notes compared with their noticeable sweet fruit-forwardness. This is especially noteworthy since both products are high-aged bourbons and often the fruit flavors fade the longer a bourbon is aged.The growing consensus with bourbon drinkers is that they desire higher aged and premium priced bourbons to be higher in proof. It would be easy to pick on this bourbon for only being 86 proof, except in this case, itâs definitely one of the more robust 86 proof bourbons on the market. At a higher proof, thereâs a good chance the oak notes would have an unhealthy effect on the bourbonâs overall palate. As is, the flavors find a happy equilibrium with one another and surprisingly donât come across as weak - a rare feat for any sub-90 proof bourbon.","Diageo is one of the few companies that continuously releases high-aged bourbons and has maintained a consistent pricing structure with them over the past few years. If you ignore for a moment whether or not you personally like these bourbons and look at them at face value based strictly on their age statements, theyâve all been reasonably priced when compared with other companiesâ high-aged bourbons.Comparing I.W. Harper 15 Year to other Diageo bourbons, its MSRP of $75 may be a bit higher than Forged Oakâs $55 (also a 15 year old bourbon), but itâs I.W. Harperâs higher quality that makes it a better overall value comparatively. Having the same price and similar flavor profile as Barterhouse (a 20 year old bourbon) doesnât necessarily make it any better or worse of a value simply because of their differences in age. In this comparison, age is really only a number since they share so many similarities. The simple fact is, there are far more companies selling similar aged bourbons for more money and many of them pale in comparison. I.W. Harper 15 Year is one of Diageoâs better sourced bourbons and because of its age statement, it can confidently command its premium price. If you also make note that many stores are selling this below MSRP, itâs an even better value.",March 2015 / Ongoing,I.W. Harper 15 Year
106, Tennessee Whiskey,Brown-Forman,Jack Daniel's Distillery,130.6,NAS, $65 (2017),"A combination of maple sugar candy and bananas lies on a bed of burnt wood. It has a somewhat smoky scent, and though the alcohol is noticeable, itâs not overpowering. Itâs rich and inviting, yet uncharacteristic of what Iâm used to in American whiskey.","Chocolatey sweet caramel and burnt wood hit first. Pipe tobacco follows, along with a good dose of bananas, some nuttiness, a bit of spice, and some of that maple sugar candy. While I canât necessarily pinpoint any other specific flavors, the overall mix comes across as somewhat odd, albeit enjoyable. This odd mix of flavors is assertive, but not to the extent I would have expected for 130.6 proof, feeling closer to 100 proof on the palate. It coats the mouth nicely with a medium-weight mouthfeel.","The heat kicks in here, quickly ramping up to a spicy almost tannic burn giving evidence of the higher proof. I might go so far as to say it borders on overly hot, culminating in the mouth and back of the throat, which might be a bit much for some. This makes for a bold and spicy finish, and though the intense heat dissipates quickly, it leaves ample amounts of burnt wood and maple sugar candy lingering in balance for quite some time.","I donât intend to offend any die hard Jack Danielâs fans by saying this, but I have never held Jack Danielâs in high esteem. In my mind Iâve always associated the brand with mass-produced mixing whiskey, which is not necessarily a correct assertion but rather based strictly on my own limited personal experience; mostly in college, mixing the flagship Old No. 7 with coke, and typically followed up with a good olâ toilet hugging session. Those were the days, right?Years later I approach whiskey in a much different way, typically enjoying neat and always seeking out new, quality experiences. As a result, the buzz surrounding this particular product has successfully landed Jack Danielâs on my radar. In anticipation of writing this review, I did some exploration into Jack Danielâs history beyond the modern-day buzz surrounding the Lincoln County Process and heated discussions as to whether or not itâs actually bourbon, which for the record, I donât care.What surprised me most is something I already knew but needed a reminder of. The brand is rich with history dating back to the the late 1800âs, so much so that in 1972 the Jack Danielâs Distillery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Despite its mass-produced and run-of-the-mill surface level feel, on paper Jack Danielâs gives purists everything they want; the company makes their own barrels, distills and ages their own whiskey, and shares a reasonable amount of information with those who are interested in seeking it out.As for the flavor profile of this whiskey, itâs uncharacteristic of others in my collection and pushes the limits on a flavor profile I would typically go for, which is accentuated by it being barrel proof. Iâve sampled from two different Jack Daniels Single Barrel Barrel Proof bottlings, and while both share some underlying similarities, they offer very different experiences, with the bottle in review having a fuller flavor profile and providing a more interesting experience by comparison. My particular bottle is by no means a perfect balance of flavors, but what it offers is exciting, unique tasting, and enjoyable; albeit a somewhat strange mix of flavors. Love it or hate it, itâs unique yet polarizing flavor profile might just be one of the best things it has going for it.","Barrel proof options offer some of the better values in whiskey, and as a result, selection is often limited as they donât tend to sit on the shelves for long (despite rapidly increasing prices in some cases). Single barrel private selections, often bottled at barrel proof, represent a good comparison to this product as there seems to be a good amount of variation between barrels and the price range is similar. Depending on your taste preference and pure luck, youâre sometimes rewarded with an exceptional bottle, and other times not so much. The risk is no different here.However, unlike some popular comparisons that would include private selections of Four Roses and Smooth Ambler Old Scout, I feel the quality floor and chance of liking Jack Danielâs are lower, resulting in a higher probability of a not-so-enjoyable bottle (anecdotally speaking). On the flip side, you might just end up with a unique tasting bottle you love thatâs also unlike anything else in your collection. Of course $65 is a premium price point, and while I donât feel there is a stellar deal here, I donât feel itâs overpriced either.",Ongoing,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Barrel Proof
107, Rye,Brown-Forman,Jack Daniel's Distillery,94,NAS, $50 (2017),"A welcoming array of cherry and banana, offset by bouts of custard, oak, and faint rye spice. A dash of ethanol is present but doesnât sabotage an otherwise nice experience. Enjoyable, and surprisingly tame in intensity, whatâs definitely notable is the restraint and overall gentleness this young whiskey is sporting. This isnât a typical bombastic rye whiskey nose, for better or for worse.","It tastes a bit simple at first. A heavy dose of banana is upfront thatâs followed by caramel and cherry. The palate never quite fully develops into an array of flavors. Instead, the highlight here is its very enjoyable buttery mouthfeel that simply settles on a baked plantain, oak, and rye spice blend thatâs straightforward and satisfying. Slightly reminiscent of Jack Danielâs No 7 flavors and characteristics the whiskey is known for, but still its own beast.",Thereâs a noticeable ethanol bite on the finish thatâs saddled with rye spice and oak. Lasting notes of cinnamon and vanilla ride out this medium length finish. Itâs on the dry side and easily the whiskeyâs weakest link.,"With ryeâs increased popularity, many new ryes have popped up on store shelves over the past few years. The majority of them have been sourced from MGP, resulting in a very similar tasting landscape. Even some of the Kentucky majors, like Woodford and Jim Beam, released new rye whiskeys, and in their particular cases have been downright lackluster. In Jack Danielâs case though, this Single Barrel Rye is one of the more interesting and unique ryes, especially for how young it is.Jack Danielâs Single Barrel Rye is the third rye product the company has released in four years and itâs clear with each release, that this line is showing more and more potential. It has a buttery mouthfeel thatâs reminiscent of Sazerac 18âs, and is fruit-forward rather than spice-forward like so many typical ryes. If the past few years of rye releases have taught me anything, itâs that rye whiskeys generally donât taste like this.","Asking $50 for a NAS rye that is known to be only about 4 years old from a company with no previous rye whiskey making experience is a lot to swallow. Jack Danielâs can only rely on their brand recognition to a point, before people ultimately ask, âwhy is this one of the more expensive ryes on the market?â Perhaps itâs simple conditioning to the price point over many years instead of a price increase with every release. For now though, itâs really a leap of faith as word-of-mouth is only now just beginning to swell about it.Kudos is due to Jack Danielâs for having the grit to release their new and untested rye as a single barrel. This likely has an effect on its higher price, but also might be adding a lot of additional character that might have been lost if it was released as a batched whiskey. Of course being a single barrel, variations do occur. After tasting three different bottles of this, two have been easily above average and one has been just above average. Regardless of the variations, it still showed me the potential this product has. It may not have convinced me to go out and purchase another bottle of this current release, but I certainly will with another year of aging under its belt.",Ongoing,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye
108, Tennessee Whiskey,Brown-Forman,Jack Daniel's Distillery,94,NAS, $48 (2017),"This single barrel is clearly built on the bones of the standard Jack Danielâs Old No. 7 offering. A delicious dose of banana bread, caramel, and heavily toasted oak, along with the slightest hint of ethanol are immediately noticeable. However, unlike the standard Jack Danielâs, Iâm happy to go back and keep smelling the nose on this whiskey. Itâs an overall simple profile that is easy to enjoy and appreciate.","Caramel, toasted oak, and dried banana chips are immediately noticeable. The whiskey has a simple sweet flavor profile and medium-weight mouthfeel that allows it to easily be rolled around in my mouth. In fact, it drinks more like an 80 proof whiskey versus the actual 94 proof that itâs bottled at.","The finish is fairly one-dimensional, consisting of chewy charred oak and a dash of brown sugar mixed with white pepper. The finish lasts for a long time, with a peppery, dry, chewy charred oak taste that lingers for quite a while after the sip. After a tasty nose and palate, I was hoping that the finish would round out the experience. Instead, the finish is just average due heavily to its one-dimensional flavor profile.","Jack Danielâs lines of whiskey have always been unique, and the single barrel version is no different. Their famous Jack Danielâs Old No. 7 charcoal filtering is evident through the entire tasting experience and heavily influences the flavors. No other whiskeys out there taste anything quite like the resulting whiskey produced. The single barrel version is able to tone down this charcoal influence and turn it into an enjoyable, albeit near average, drinking experience.Compared to the bold in-your-face Jack Danielâs Single Barrel Barrel Proof edition, the single barrel version is much more balanced, and this is where the whiskey is at its best. Itâs more well-rounded than the standard Jack Danielâs, while also being much more balanced than the barrel proof version. The end result, while not mind blowing, is the most enjoyable drinking experience that Jack Danielâs has to offer.","The standard Jack Danielâs offering has been a staple for many individuals for its availability and low price point. It may not deliver a standout drinking experience, but it does deliver an economical one. At double the price of the standard Jack Danielâs, the same canât be said for Jack Danielâs Single Barrel. While I find the flavor profile of the single barrel to be much better than the standard offering, there are also a lot of other whiskeys and bourbons in the marketplace that I would recommend in the $40-$50 price range before purchasing this.Thatâs not a knock against this whiskey. Clearly the flavor profile may be more well-rounded than you find with the standard Jack Danielâs, however in the end itâs not worth double the price. This seems to be the industry standard of other producers of single barrel whiskeys who tend to price their single barrel offerings much higher than their batched counterparts. Thatâs an okay pricing strategy to have when your single barrel offering is head and shoulders above and can compete well with its price point peers. Plain and simple though, this is a whiskey that should be selling more in the $35-$40 range versus the almost $50 itâs going for.",Ongoing,Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select
109, Straight Rye,Brown-Forman,Jack Daniel's Distillery,90,NAS, $27 (2018),"Immediately out of the gate thereâs a commanding presence of cherry, banana, hay, and custard. It mostly forgoes traditional rye notes and only fleetingly sports any spice and grain - not that thereâs anything wrong with that. This is another Jack rye that bucks traditional expectations and presents an eccentric set of aromas that is both pleasant and unexpected.","A heavy dose of banana that's immediately followed by...more banana. Oak notes sweep in from time to time which can make this taste almost like banana nut bread. Itâs largely a smooth drinking experience that sports a medium-thick mouthfeel. As the banana subsides, a bit of grain cereal come to the forefront. Itâs a little strange tasting but interesting nevertheless.",Itâs odd in that this mild finish is lacking in both flavor and mouthfeel. Itâs a very straightforward affair with a singular focus on oak and accompanying dryness. The lack of spice is really felt on the finish because it would have added an extra dimension thatâs missing. The weak flavor body of its finish does this whiskey a great disservice.,"Jack Danielâs once again deserves credit for a unique tasting rye whiskey that stands out from other ryes on the market. But that will only get them so far and benefit them for so long. For a batched product, a good amount of what made their Single Barrel Rye great can still be tasted here, but clearly some of those characteristics were lost in the batching process. Its mouthfeel is nowhere near as creamy, and while still fruit-forward, it lacks the same intensity.  Itâs overall a more straightforward rye that most notably sports more banana notes than probably any other rye whiskey on the market.","Thereâs been a flood of rye whiskey hitting the market over the past few years with many falling in the $25-$35 price range. The thing is, the many of them have also been largely forgettable. From the start, Jack Danielâs rye products have tasted different. With each passing year and a perceived additional year of aging, they continually show signs of improvement.I noted in my Single Barrel Rye review that it was âa unique tasting and buttery rye thatâs already showing signs of greatness even at a young age.â I also noted that I couldnât get behind its $50 price tag and a batched product might remedy this. I didn't expect a year later the company would do just that, and even price it at a very reasonable $27. Part of me figured the whiskey might take a hit in quality - and it did - but at almost half the price, isnât that acceptable? For its price, its complexity is very much in line with many of its peers, but its unique Jack Danielâs Rye flavor profile is what makes it much more memorable for me and will most likely be my new go to sub $35 sipping rye. However, comparing it directly to Jackâs other ryes, if cost isnât an issue, the Single Barrel Rye is still superior in every way.",October 2017/Ongoing,Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye
110, Tennessee Whiskey,Brown-Forman,Jack Danielâs Distillery,80,NAS, $22 (2019),"A pleasant mix of fruity sweetness, vanilla custard, oak, and banana. Itâs medium in intensity, yet still has a decent richness to it  Apricot and corn provide an additional layer of nuance. These scents culminate into an enjoyable and immensely satisfying opening to this whiskey.","A rush of corn and banana upfront thatâs followed by sugary blend of vanilla and walnut. Minor traces of smoke, cinnamon, and maple creep in and help add some additional nuance. Although its thin mouthfeel is regrettable and 80 proof unappealing, it thankfully drinks ever so slightly hotter. This all adds up to a palate that is distinctly Jack and makes it surprisingly fun to drink."," Forgoing much of the sweetness found in its palate, the finish is oaky, slightly bitter, and at times almost briney. Itâs a strong contrast to the sweet nose and palate, and leaves a mildly dry and tongue zapping funkiness thatâs a hard contrast to the other parts of this whiskey. Itâs a detrimental finish to an otherwise solid overall pour.","A lot of fun has been had arguing whether the standard Jack Danielâs qualifies as bourbon or not. But the discussion always comes back to the Lincoln County Process. Some may say that it hides flaws that would otherwise be more pronounced, but that is largely inconsequential as so many other brands use many different means of filtering. Jack Danielâs has also been making whiskey for 150 years and itâs hard to argue that after perfecting their technique for so long, that they make poor products. This is highlighted by their entry into rye production and how impressive their rye products have been out of the gate.  As for the standard Jack Danielâs, it's quite difficult to mistake it for another average budget whiskey due to its memorable nose and unique palate, which can probably be traced back to the Lincoln County Process. Besides the brandâs quintessential banana notes, it offers a sweet and fruit-forward palate that makes it stand out and constantly reminds you youâre drinking Jack. When I compared it to a Jack Danielâs Single Barrel Barrel Proof flavor profile, I surprisingly found more nuance with the standardâs profile. Yes it was a single barrel and barrels can vary, but the result wasnât what I was expecting and shows the standard Jack Danielâs does have its moments. ","The standard Jack Danielâs has always been known as a budget whiskey. That of course comes with an assumption that itâs a subpar whiskey that college kids drink because they donât know or canât afford any better, and with its reputation as a staple mixer with Coca-Cola. Along with brands like Jim Beam and Makerâs Mark, which can be found in just about any bar in America, it further adds to peopleâs assumption that these brands arenât worth your time and money. On the flip side, the brand also has its passionate, and at times, rabid fanbase. It would seem odd for a whiskey to have such a following if it was in fact a swill whiskey. Much like I found when I reviewed Makerâs Mark, unfounded reputations certain brands carry arenât always true. Jack Danielâs is a superb value for the whiskey in its bottle. While I didnât find that to be true with Jim Beam White Label, Jack Danielâs can be a decent sipping whiskey despite its low proof and downer finish.",,Jack Danielâs Tennessee Whiskey
111, Straight Bourbon,Jefferson's,Sourced,90,NAS (See notes), $70 (2014),"Nice with elements of vanilla, caramel, and burnt wood.","Savory with a wonderfully thick and coating mouthfeel. Sweet elements of butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, and burnt brown sugar balance nicely with an opposing bitterness. There is some heat and delicious elements of fresh wood, not overpowering though. Iâll clear this up in case youâre wondering - itâs not salty. As I understand it, salt is used by chefs in just about every dish, including desserts, because it enhances the flavor of just about anything. I would agree there is a possibility of some saltiness in here as a flavor enhancer, I just donât taste it as a separate element.","Medium length with sweetness from the palate at first followed by a fairly strong bitterness. This was my least favorite part of the sip, but not horrible.","The ocean-aging alone makes this unique, but it doesnât stop there. The end result is a fairly complex bourbon with a wonderfully rich mouthfeel. There are more good wood flavors here than any other bourbon I can think of under 15 years of age. It seems that the movement of the liquid within the barrels really allowed for a better extraction of wood-driven flavor elements than a typical aging process. Whether or not ocean air made itâs way into the barrels and had any impact is unclear to me. As I understand it, the liquid seeps through the wood of the barrel and evaporates, rather than outside air making its way into the barrel on a regular basis. In other words, Iâm not really sure barrels breathe air in and out to a significant extent. Assuming some ocean air did make its way in, Iâm not certain air with some higher salt content within the barrel would have much of an impact on the flavor of the juice. Either way, it does seem reasonable after tasting it that the combination of movement, temperature fluctuation, and a different environment created on a boat actually contributed to the end result in a noticeable and positive way.","Call this a gimmick if you like, but Iâm all for the idea of trying something different like this. Someone has to be the first to do it and Iâm proud to support that, even if it means paying a little more for a 7-8 year old bourbon than the norm. I expect there will be price gouging on this one - so far even the liquor stores are increasing their price right out of the gate. This is not a $100 bottle, but it may be worth that for anyone as interested in the concept as I am. With only 13,500 bottles for purchase, I have a feeling bourbon enthusiasts all over will be scrambling to experience this for themselves and that will naturally drive the price up. For that reason, anything under $100 is probably within the realm of reason, simply considering supply and demand. Anything over $100 is probably a bit much. I would suggest trying a pour at a bar before shelling out the bucks for this unless you donât mind paying a little extra to try something different.",March 2014,Jefferson's Ocean Aged At Sea Voyage 2
112, Straight Bourbon,Jefferson's,Sourced,90,NAS, $85 (2014),A strong dose of raisins and citrus hits with a great deal more intensity than youâd expect for 90 proof.,"Raisins come through immediately and dominate the whole sip, making it very sweet throughout. Spice and alcohol come into play as well, ramping up quickly once the bourbon enters your mouth and pushing into the finish. Like the intensity on the nose, thereâs more flavor and spice intensity than youâd expect for the proof.","Along with the spice the raisins continue to pull through. That citrus detected on the nose also makes itself present again. The intense spice drops off quickly leaving a faint but sweet, fruity aftertaste that continues to linger for a while.","Being the third ocean voyage from Jeffersonâs with a rumored 200 barrels, I would estimate around 54,000 total bottles for this release. The bottle design has changed slightly from the second release and Iâll let you study our photos on this page and our Ocean II review page to find the nuances between them for yourself rather than try to explain them here. What this suggests is that Jeffersonâs is making this an ongoing endeavor, so we might expect to see some consistency in flavor profile at some point.For the time being, the flavor profile of this third release is very different from the previous one. Unfortunately, the intense contrast of bitter and sweet along with an incredibly rich mouthfeel found in Ocean II are completely lost on this third release. Jeffersonâs delivers a more balanced and mainstream flavor profile with Ocean III, but sacrifices the characteristics I found to be the most appealing and unique with Ocean II. Knowing the time at sea for Ocean II was somewhere between 5-10 months (some rumors suggest 7-8 as a tighter range), and the fact that both II and III were released in 2014 suggests that their sea voyages were different times of the year and could have resulted in very different aging conditions while at sea. Alternatively, this is sourced bourbon and we have no clue where its from, so it could even be a completely different mash bill than Ocean II.For me, this release lacks the unique flavor characteristics that would suggest an impact on flavor profile due to ocean aging. Not only that, the idea of aging at sea as something exciting is starting to wear off as Jeffersonâs has released zero info on this particular voyage so far from what I could find.","$85, mash bill unknown, source unknown, age unknown, time at sea unknown, additional background unknown, decent overall bourbon. Except for the last item those are the facts. I argued adamantly in my Ocean II review that the concept of ocean aging is not a gimmick, which was based solely on my personal opinion of the flavor profile presented by Ocean II. The Ocean II has flavor characteristics I have never identified in another bourbon and I downright love the complexity of the sip. With this release, Iâm not so sure. Itâs a very good bourbon that maintains more balance and delivers a much sweeter sip than the last release. Itâs good, but not $85 good. Iâd peg this at around $40 considering the lack of background shared with the public and the quality of other bourbons I can buy in the $40 range.",October 2014,Jefferson's Ocean Aged At Sea Voyage 3
113, Straight Bourbon,Jefferson's,Sourced,90,NAS, $85 (2015),Vanilla and raisins are complemented by dry wood. Itâs similar to Ocean 3 but with added dryness and a little more tingle in the nostrils.,"Sweet, spicy, and bitter flavors compete seemingly all at once. Traditional flavors of caramel and vanilla are balanced with manageable amounts of raisins and citrus. Not as thick of a mouthfeel as Ocean 2 and more complex than Ocean 3.","Rye spice takes over at first, but dissipates quickly. Traces of vanilla, raisins, and dry wood remain. It turns somewhat bitter here at first but not overly so. Brown sugar also lingers on the taste buds rounding out the bitterness making for a sweet, medium-length finish.","As weâve recently learned the mashbill for this release (25-30% rye) is different than Ocean 1 (20% rye) and Ocean 2 (around 33% rye). Weâre told that future voyages will be the same mashbill as this one. The bourbon loaded onto ships for this voyage was around 6-7 years old before its sea voyage and was distilled in Kentucky, as compared with Ocean 2 out of Indiana. The bitterness and dry wood elements I noticed in Ocean 4 provide more substantial evidence of what a sea voyage might do to bourbon than the flavor characteristics I found in Ocean 3. Where Ocean 3 provided a more heavy-handed dose of sweetness and raisins, Ocean 4 shares the same underlying characteristics but delivers them in a more balanced and complex sip.","In the enthusiast community youâll find a wide range of opinions on Jeffersonâs, Trey Zoeller, and this whole concept. Love it, hate it, thatâs your opinion and a range of opinions, especially strong opinions, makes for more interesting discussion. Iâll describe my own opinion as open, curious, and skeptical. But letâs be clear about one thing, no matter what your take - this is an experiment and youâre paying a premium to taste the results of this experiment. You can find equal, better, older, or more balanced bourbons for a lot less money.But alas, weâre bourbon geeks and really like the experimental side of things, as evidenced by our Bourbon Storage Experiment and more experiments we have in the works. Weâve purchased and reviewed Ocean 2, 3, and now 4 because weâre just that curious and a lot of readers have asked us to review this rendition. To that end, weâd been growing increasingly frustrated with Jeffersonâs lack of publicized details on these releases, so we reached out to them with a list of fairly pointed questions. We were happy that Trey Zoeller, Jefferson's founder and master blender, responded to us with some details we couldn't find anywhere else. The full Q&A with Trey can be found here.We hope Jefferson's recognizes the community would prefer more information about what goes into making this Ocean bourbon and provides us with it. Knowing more about this actually increases this bourbon's value in my opinion.So all in, youâre getting a 6-7 year-old Kentucky sourced bourbon, possibly with a similar mashbill and age as something else on the shelf for a fraction of the priceâ¦ however, youâre also enjoying the opportunity to taste the results of this aged-at-sea experiment. Thereâs cost to transport these barrels and load them onto ships. No other company is aging bourbon at sea. If youâre ok with this then go for it, youâre not going to find any other options that fit this bill. What youâll find in the bottle is good bourbon, just not any better than some bourbons you can find for a fraction of the price. But isnât that true of many of the higher priced options anyway? [1]",January 2015,Jefferson's Ocean Aged at Sea Voyage 4
114, Straight Bourbon,Castle Brands,Sourced (Blend of up to 4 Kentucky Straight Bourbons),82.3,NAS, $33 (2019),"Classic bourbon notes of corn, vanilla, and oak are all front and center. Hiding behind are lighter floral notes and ripe plum. A simple nose that while lacking in depth, is easy to dissect and enjoy.","Slightly sweet, the palate again is on the simpler side. Vanilla and oak are the main flavors of the sip. Underneath are slight hints of honey and cherry. Thereâs not much depth, and the low proof doesnât help this.","The sip ends with an extremely short finish. Light hints of vanilla and slightly aged oak are the only discernible flavors. While the nose and palate might not have set a high bar to beat, the finish isnât even able to match them and ends the bourbon on an incredibly forgettable note.","Jefferson's has not been bashful in exploring the innovative and unique side of bourbon production, and in fact is one of the more progress brands willing to try new experimentations in the bourbon space. Their Jeffersonâs Ocean Aged at Sea along with their cask finished products are some of the most innovative in the market. However while Jefferson's claim of low barrel lots in their Very Small Batch bourbon may have been unique when it was initially released, many smaller distilleries utilize a similar practice today. Its flavor profile isnât readily distinguishable from other small batches, allowing class leaders such as Four Roses Small Batch which sells in the same price range to stand out even more. Jeffersonâs Very Small Batch finds itself resting on its laurels which doesnât propel it to stand out nowadays.","Sure the price tag may not be high, but its flavor profile, even for a $30 bourbon, is lacking. I personally would take any of the bourbons on our Best of $30 - $40 list and even many on our Best of $20 - $30 list before buying another bottle of Jeffersonâs Very Small Batch. Itâs not that the bourbon is discernibly bad, itâs just unfortunately playing in a very competitive price range that has some excellent everyday selections that deliver a better flavor to value ratio.",Ongoing,Jefferson's Very Small Batch
115, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam Distillery,86,NAS (said to be in the 6 year range), $25 (2017),"A pleasant display of vanilla custard, candied apple, and light oak. It has a nice intensity for an 86 proof bourbon and itâs very likeable overall.","As soon as the bourbon hit my tongue itâs immediately noticeable how thin this is and the flavors seem to mimic this. Oak dominates the palate only letting in fleeting hints of vanilla and caramel. A very straightforward display of flavors that is in no way bad, just a bit boring.","Oak, smoky char, and lingering vanilla all pepper the medium-length finish. These flavors  do a decent job of sticking around despite the bourbonâs thin consistency. Again there arenât many nuances to the flavors and they come across very matter-of-fact.","Jim Beam makes great bourbon and itâs on display in their Small Batch series which includes Knob Creek, Basil Hayden's, Baker's, and Bookerâs. Based on how Jim Beam Black Extra Aged is positioned and marketed in Beamâs portfolio, it fills the gap between the inexpensive and basic Jim Beam White and the companyâs more expensive and complex small batch bourbons. Extra Aged certainly offers a fuller flavor compared to Jim Beam White, but it is still miles away from Knob Creek (the least expensive of Beamâs small batch bourbons).Beamâs namesake bourbons have always come up short for me. Theyâre overly simple and lack any of the richness found in Beamâs higher-tier bourbons. While that can be expected based on the large price discrepancy between the brands, the quality discrepancy is the shocking part. Buffalo Trace, Evan Williams, Heaven Hill, and Wild Turkey donât seem to experience the same drastic dip in quality between their pricing tiers that Jim Beam does. In a vacuum, Jim Beam Blackâs placement and quality might be good enough in their brand portfolio, but comparing it to the less expensive Evan Williams, equally priced Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon, or slightly more expensive Buffalo Trace and Makerâs Mark, it just doesnât stack up. Extra Aged is simply too one-note with heavy oak dominating the already basic flavor profile it sports.","Sometimes bourbons can live a happy life maintaining a sweet spot in the bourbon marketâs price structure. Amazingly, simply being a few dollars more or less than the competition can signal quality or value to the consumer. Despite the brand going through multiple name changes and losing its age statement, which suggests Beamâs struggles with the brand, it will probably survive and flourish as a classic tasting bourbon at a fair value. With bourbonâs $20 price range changing, that just might be a glimpse of Extra Agedâs future.",Ongoing,Jim Beam Black XA Extra Aged
116, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam Distillery,80,4 Years, $15 (2017),"Corn, light fruit and alcohol pretty much sum the nose up on this one. It's basic with no depth.",Typical bourbon flavors of caramel and vanilla. Tiny amount of fruit and honey. Very ho-hum palate with weak flavor all around.,Smooth mellow finish with medium length. Corn and vanilla are present but overall the finish leaves little impression on you.,"It's hard to find anything unique about this bourbon. If it wasnât for the brandâs long history and strong marketing technique, it would likely be a flop if coming onto the market today.  But before the pitchforks come out, let me back up my point. Jim Beam white label isnât meant to be unique. Itâs mellow, low proof and low cost for a reason: so as many people can enjoy it as possible. Thereâs nothing inherently bad about the bourbon. Itâs designed for any level of bourbon drinker, or for that matter any alcohol drinker, to not be offended by the taste. That is why you see it in every bar in America.","Jim Beam is a budget bourbon pure and simple. Probably more times than not, itâs where many people start their bourbon journey. Its low proof and price make it a great place to start. For people who want to make whiskey mixed drinks, low price is often the number one thing theyâre looking for. If weâre going to critically look at this bourbon though, then all of the bourbonâs attributes must be examined. Its mild flavor, lack of complexity and low proof point donât make it a great sipper. There are many fantastic bourbons on the market for $5 dollars more. At just $10 dollars more, there are many bourbons that are light years ahead of this.",Ongoing,Jim Beam White Label Bourbon
117, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,A. Smith Bowman Distillery,100,NAS (Press materials state between 9-10 years old), $50 (2017),"Baking chocolate, baked bread, oak, vanilla, and green apple, and a dash of toffee lead the way. A light tingling of ethanol is present but not so much to be distracting. The aromas arenât overly strong, but more subtle and pleasant to the senses.","Taking a large sip reveals classic bourbon undertones with a touch of sweetness. Itâs a creamy bodied bourbon that offers rich flavors. Rich malted chocolate, oak, vanilla, and hints of corn syrup immediately jump out. This is a bourbon that plays it safe in the sense that you wonât be overwhelmed with a massive set of flavors to dissect. That said, while it doesnât have that wow factor of a standout bourbon, it sure doesnât disappoint in what it delivers either.","Balanced and long. Warming heat slowly builds as it makes its way down your throat. A hint of spice in the form of green pepper, along with chocolate, leather, oak, and hints of vanilla start the finish. These flavors morph to light traces of chocolatey caramel that coat the mouth, and linger for a long time between sips. Balanced, flavorful, and unpretentious, the finish nicely encapsulates what this bourbon is all about.","Like the other bourbons produced from the A. Smith Bowman Distillery, John J. Bowman Single Barrel carries with it a unique background. If the rumors that this is made of distillate from Buffalo Traceâs mashbill #1 are true, it would share the same undertones as the E.H Taylor line and Eagle Rare. It also presents a great lesson in just how much aging factors into the taste of a bourbon.In theory these distant cousins should be closer in flavor than they are. Instead the additional distillation and standalone aging in Virginia produces a bourbon that doesnât exactly scream Buffalo Trace either. The end result isnât one that really distinguishes itself from other single barrels on the market, but nevertheless still offers an enjoyable sip.","Priced at $50, John J. Bowman Single Barrel finds itself surrounded by some tough competition. Not only does it face off against Blantonâs and E.H Taylor Single Barrel, but also Four Roses Single Barrel and Knob Creek Single Barrel which cost slightly less. Each of these aforementioned bourbons offers a more memorable experience. Thatâs not to say that John J. Bowman Single Barrel presents a poor value. While it may not offer enough distinct characteristics to make it stand apart, it actually feels to be priced perfectly right in todayâs marketplace.",Ongoing,John J. Bowman Single Barrel
118, Straight Bourbon,Johnny Drum Distilling Company / Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (Willett),Undisclosed,101,NAS, $35 (2017),"Ethanol is assertive on the nose with hints of tobacco and caramel filtering through. Even sitting in the glass for a while, the ethanol seems to overpower whatever other aromas might be faintly present.","Loads of sweet caramel and vanilla break first, saturating the senses with a notable intensity that hugs the tongue. Bursts of tobacco and leather follow. A touch of smoky char along with a hint of custard round things out. The fusion of flavors on the palate is more rich than it is balanced, but what it offers is quite enjoyable.","Itâs here that spice makes its first appearance. Itâs warming and pronounced, but not specific. Thereâs also a touch of smokiness. Brown sugar sweetness develops and lingers, making for a medium-length, elegant finish.","The particular bottle of Johnny Drum sampled for this review was purchased a while ago, maybe even as much as 2-3 years. During that time I may have had it once or twice, as it went largely unnoticed gathering dust towards the back of my shelves. So the question becomes, now that Iâve gotten to know it better, does it stand out from the crowd?While it no longer carries the 15 year age statement it once did quite some time ago, I canât speak to the consistency of the non-age stated version of Johnny Drum Private Stock from batch to batch. The batches themselves are likely rather small, meaning consistency, or lack thereof, is a consideration. Moreover, the distillation source is unknown, so while Willett maintains control over the brand there is an additional layer of production they must contend with. Rumors suggest Heaven Hill as the source, and given the proximity to their distillery, the flavor profile, and quality of the bourbon itâs certainly believable.Johnny Drum Private Stock offers a flavor profile thatâs not overly unique in a general sense, but a more robust one than you might expect for the price. Itâs proofed right at 101, and as a result what it lacks in balance, it makes up for in intensity.","Johnny Drum Private Stock isnât a perfect bourbon by any means. The aromas on the nose are overpowered by ethanol and the sip is more intense than it is balanced. But considering its price point, it stands out. In fact, itâs becoming more difficult to find such deep intensity of flavors and character at the price point as age statements disappear and more producers push bourbons to market. This makes it worthy of your attention considering the crowded landscape of bourbons in the range, that, aside from their bottle and label designs, seem to be moving closer to center. So while the flavor profile itself isnât overly unique, this bourbon is notably good for the price.",Ongoing,Johnny Drum Private Stock Bourbon
119, Straight Bourbon	 ,Stoli Group	,Sourced (from undisclosed distillery[ies] in Kentucky),96.4,NAS,,"Hints of aged oak mingle with light caramel and leather. Delicate and understated, itâs interesting, and signals towards the whiskey being aged longer than I would have expected.","A nicely rounded mouthfeel delivers graham crackers, tobacco, and seasoned oak. The flavors are delicate here as they were in the nose, leaning away from sweeter flavors towards the savory side of the scale.","Slightly bitter, the finish turns towards a dry leather note at first. Cinnamon spice picks up later, bringing a satisfying pop of spice. Aged oak caps it off. Itâs a long, complex, and surprisingly enjoyable finish.","While Confiscated doesnât carry an age statement, the flavor profile suggests an higher age than I expected, with oak-forward characteristics. The bourbon also has dimension, with more complexity than average, and a finish that stands out. But for me, when thinking about what makes a whiskey unique I always think about whatâs beyond the glass. The process that goes into making bourbon is a large part of what makes it enjoyable to drink. Thinking about the recipe, the care it took to distill it, the year it was put into oak, where the barrel might have sat in the rickhouse. Maybe itâs released uncut and unfiltered giving drinkers a unique experience.We donât always know everything about the bourbon we drink, but in this case we know very little. Knowing simply that this bourbon was distilled in Kentucky and aged at least four years isnât enough. The flavor profile is good suggesting experienced blending, but there's otherwise nothing provided to suggest anything else about this bourbon is unique.","A large part of my need for more background on this bourbon is driven by the price. If this was priced at $25, or even approached $50, itâs an easy buy based on taste. But it comes in much higher than that - $125. This whiskey has no distillery disclosure, no age statement, no mashbill disclosure, no details of sourcing or blending, and no details identifying something special about its creation. This makes its $125 price tag, quite literally, hard to swallow.But looking at it from a different perspective Kentucky Owl is arguably smart to set the price high. If the market accepts it, then they set a bar for their brand proving that a widely distributed bourbon that simply bears the Kentucky Owl label, and nothing more, is worthy of an ultra premium price tag.It's as if they've been working towards this since the first release.Most previous releases saw low bottle counts, higher proofs, some age statements or at least details, and details about the whiskey's curation. They sold for a premium, which continued to increase with the previous bourbon, Batch 8, retailing for a whopping $300. These previous releases helped build an acceptable price point north of $100 for the brand.Confiscated doesn't seem notably different than previous releases on first glance. To the unknowing consumer Confiscated looks no different. While it may be mass produced, widely distributed, and provide minimal details on whatâs inside the bottle, many seeing it on the shelf wonât necessarily realize this.But itâs not just about an age statement, proof, distribution, or bottle count. Itâs about something. Anything. For $125, I want to know more about this bourbon than Kentucky Owl is telling us.",,Kentucky Owl Confiscated
120, Straight Rye,Stoli Group,Sourced,110.6,11 Years, $130 (2017),"A classic undertone of rye spice dominates the nose. Itâs joined by green apple, fresh pine needles, pie crust, and hints of vanilla and oak. For 110.6 proof, itâs surprising to see how nonexistent the ethanol scent is. Its aromas come off as delicate but also well defined.","Big doses of rye spice come into frame, along with the fruit that carries through from the nose. Additional hints of vanilla and oak are also present. The palate starts off sweet, but morphs towards a drier profile after coating the mouth. Itâs easy to hold the whiskey in your mouth and pick apart the flavors due in large part to the absence of any burn. If I didnât know any better, I would have pegged this closer to 100 proof. Really pleasing and delicious.","Dry overall with oak and rye dominating the beginning of the finish. The heat ramps up a few seconds into the finish and this is where the rye finally shows its proof. Itâs fleeting though, as it dies down quickly giving way to a mixture of rye, pine, a light pepper mixture, leather, nutmeg, and cigar box. The finish eventually slims down to a heavy dose of pine and rye which lingers for a long time. Itâs okay, and clearly the weakest part of the overall flavor profile.","Aged ryes are a rarity in todayâs marketplace. Even rarer are ryes aged over 10 years old. After you add in the fact that this is high proof, Kentucky Owl has all of the pieces of a unique marketplace offering going for it. That is until you start to compare it to what else is out there.My first comparison was to a 7 year old Redemption Rye Barrel Proof bottle, and I quickly realized that this wasnât an apples to apples comparison. The Redemption Rye had a unique MGP rye flavor profile which didn't align with this Kentucky Owl release. My second comparison proved to be a much better rival to the Owl in the form of Pikesville 6 Year Rye Whiskey. Even though Pikesville is 5 years younger, itâs almost the exact same proof and is also a Kentucky distilled rye just like Kentucky Owl. The Pikesville contained a bolder flavor compared to the Owl, which I found it to be more exciting and refreshing.Thatâs the crux with this Kentucky Owl release: its flavor profile for the most part is well rounded and easy to like, however itâs not a lot different than other ryes in the marketplace. Age may help it stand out, but doesnât necessarily help it differentiate itself from other competitors when it comes down to flavor profile.","Thereâs no beating around the bush on this price tag. Plain and simple, this is overpriced. Even in todayâs marketplace, a $130 bottle needs to hold up and really shine through in order to be able to justify the price. Though its flavor profile delivers the goods, itâs still hard to justify the price considering you can buy two bottles of Pikesville 6 year rye with money to spare. Honestly, a more appropriate and fair price for this release would be right around $100.",September 2017,Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 01
121, Straight Rye,Stoli Group,Sourced (from undisclosed distillery[ies] in Kentucky),101.8,11 Years, $200 (2018),"A medium intensity scent billows out of the glass and lures you in with its welcoming aromas. A dessert bakery bouquet of vanilla, custard, caramel, buttercream frosting, and nutmeg. Pleasing and hard to resist.","The dessert bakery theme continues into the palate as toffee, caramel, and vanilla flavors come into focus. Milder notes of cherry, cinnamon, and rye spice are present, but donât overpower adding a nice layer of depth. Itâs a crowd pleaser of flavors that are made smoother thanks to its proof.","The sweeter notes drop off leaving a medium dry, slightly spicy aftertaste. Cinnamon notes and its overall hotness ramp up against a backdrop of leather, burnt caramel, and oak. Itâs a nice counter to the sweeter and softer side of the whiskey and reminds the drinker that at its core, this is a rye whiskey.","There are a lot of ryes on the market thanks to its resurgence in popularity in recent years. Many, unfortunately, donât stand out from the masses as most tend to blend together. Some of this has to do with many of them originating from the same distillery (MGP Ingredients), while some is due to simply rushing products to the market. Despite constantly being told rye can be better young, in reality, itâs often the old ryes that are the most memorable and sport the most character.Both Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 1 and Batch 2 are excellent examples of this. They have more depth and complexity than you get from a typical rye. Batch 1 is 9 proof points higher than Batch 2, and tastes like it. I prefer it to Batch 2, but it certainly isnât as drinkable. It will largely depend on who youâre drinking with and the mood youâre in, but each Batch is memorable in its own way. They still very much straddle what traditional rye tastes like, but are better constructed and more developed than the average rye.","Kentucky Owl states in their press release that they â...crafted this straight rye whiskey to be more approachable to the casual drinker, while containing all the good parts of whiskey without any of the bad.â While that statement is somewhat laughable since what company actively tries to leave the bad in (also what does that even mean?), but the first part rings 100% true. Lowering the proof and focusing on crowd pleasing flavors makes this very drinkable for just about anyone. The rub is, if they were focusing on more casual drinkers, why the $70 price increase from Batch 1? That is the hardest part to swallow about Batch 2. While Batch 2 might not be light years ahead of products half their price, there is an incremental quality bump that they feel equals an exponential bump in price. The company did the same thing with Batch 8 of their bourbon, which saw a bump from $200 to $350. Yes Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 2 is a good whiskey, but the price jump in 9 months simply doesnât compute.",June 2018,Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 02
122, Straight Bourbon,Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (KBD),Undisclosed,90,NAS, $29 (2017),"A good amount of alcohol at first, but as your nose adjusts to it, caramel takes over completely. Itâs actually quite pleasant. Subtle hints of corn and rye also develop as more air mixes with the bourbon. A decent about of oak also shines through.","A medium-bodied bourbon with a warm buttery smooth texture. The first sip has a good degree of alcohol flavor in it. It can be surprising but also a little off putting. What the palate lacks, the finish helps make up for.","Smokey and oaky. This has far more weight than many in its price range. It also packs a manageable amount of heat for a 90 proof bourbon. Unfortunately, itâs not a terribly complex bourbon. Flavors donât mingle and intertwine as well as some bourbons. In some sips, the oak and the grain/corn flavors completely overpower everything else.","Thereâs nothing ground-breaking here, although it does stand out as a more smoky bourbon than many of its peers. Most of the time, itâs the more aged, more expensive bourbons that have this characteristic. This affordable smoky bourbon can therefore make for a decent mixer that can stand up to other ingredients that may be mixed with it.","Willettâs other entry-level bourbons: Pure Kentucky, Johnny Drum, Old Bardstown Estate all share similar traits to Kentucky Vintage. Theyâre all quality bourbons that are priced right. They have varying degrees of complexity yet are still far from refined.

123, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman,132.9,14 Years, $200 (2018),"This nose is full of flavor right from the get go. Baking chocolate, spiced raisins, cinnamon stick, preserved peaches, crispy baked pie crust, sweet aged leather, and an underlying hint of something else that I just canât place my finger on. Ethanol is definitely present, but doesnât distract from the other aromas. This nose smells delicious, especially considering the proof itâs clocking in at.","The palate allows the proof of this bourbon to shine in full force. This is a big bold bourbon that owns its proof proudly. The sip starts with a lot of heat dominating up front. Searching beyond it I find rye spice, leather, baking chocolate, white pepper, and a dab of sweetness. Even though the flavors have to fight through the intense heat for attention, they play very well together for this high proofer. While I do wish they didnât have to fight the heat as much, this also isnât unexpected due to the bourbon's high proof and ultimately doesnât detract from the experience too much.","A warmth lingers in my mouth after the sip finishes. Itâs immediately noticeable that the sweetness from the nose and palate are gone. The age of this bourbon becomes apparent in the predominant form of dry tannic oak and leather, which are are joined with a slight hint of green peppercorns. The finish lingers on oak and leather along with a heat that stays in your chest for a while. The finish isnât bad by any means, but compared to the nose and palate itâs the most uneventful part of the sip.","Letâs get this out of the way, King of Kentucky will not be the best 14 year old bourbon youâll ever taste. Far from it. There are many Willetts that are as old or older and are also single barrel barrel proof that drink better. That said, King of Kentucky is still a really good bourbon and one that is distinct in the Brown-Forman lineup as it is made up of a mashbill consistent with high aged Early Times stockTo date, this is the oldest, and with the exception of the barrels lower in proof than the 2018 Woodford Reserve Batch Proof, the highest proof bourbon released by Brown-Forman. It wears its age on its sleeve and tastes unlike other Brown-Forman bourbons. It has the umpf of Old Forester 1920 with additional heat, the richer notes found in Woodford Batch Proof, and sweeter notes found in the nose of some other Woodford products. Additionally, there are characteristics found throughout the sip that only come with time in the barrel. While a single barrel, barrel proof bourbon isnât anything new, compared to others in the Brown-Forman portfolio King of Kentucky is as unique as they come.","King of Kentucky is Brown-Formanâs most expensive bourbon ever released. Their stated justification for the $200 price tag is that âthe price reflects the rarity of the product, but allows it to be accessible to whiskey connoisseurs.â Initial gut instinct may be to roll your eyes, but having given this a lot of thought there is more to meet the eye on the price tag.Looking at the marketplace in 2018, $200 for a limited release seems to be right in the middle of where pricing tends to be. Some releases are lower, like the artificially low priced Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, while some are higher like WhistlePigâs overpriced Dark Prince Rye. Normally I would roll my eyes at the saying that the market can justify it so itâs fine, however in comparison to other releases, $200 isnât out of line in this specific case.King of Kentucky is a very limited release consisting of under 1,000 bottles. If you thought the Russellâs Reserve 1998 & 2002 releases were limited releases, King of Kentucky sets the benchmark for limited non-gift shop releases from a major distillery. Considering the limited amount released, $200 isnât completely out of line. Additionally, not only are you buying a very limited bourbon, but a very enjoyable drinking bourbon at that. Iâm okay with higher pricing for limited releases when itâs justifiable and the product delivers. In this case, King of Kentucky is just under the threshold for what I would consider reasonable. Sure I can buy a bottle of Old Forester 1920 from Brown-Forman for about a third of the price, but thatâs going to deliver a very different drinking experience compared to King of Kentucky.Now in regards to the second part of that quote from Brown-Forman regarding pricing it to be accessible to all whiskey connoisseurs, that is debatable. Sure the price may be reasonable and allow many folks to buy versus pricing this at $500 or more, but when you sell a product in only one state, that makes it hard to justify it being âaccessibleâ in the truest sense. That nitpick aside, I walk away form this review feeling that Brown-Forman actually picked a reasonable price for King of Kentucky.",May 2018,King of Kentucky Bourbon - 2018 Release
124, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,122.1,NAS (Age ranges from 12-13 years based on company press release and determined by barreled date on label), $130 (2017),"Cinnamon sticks, seasoned oak, and tobacco are countered by the scent of sweet caramel. Itâs in your face and potent, but not overly hot. Very nice overall.","A dollop of spice lands on entry, and it feels satisfyingly heavy on the tongue. A burn is present but not overpowering, allowing you to roll the bourbon around in your mouth long enough to experience the flavors. Itâs bold and delicious, with charred oak, allspice, and tobacco against a blanket of sweet vanilla.","The finish kicks off with a blast of cinnamon spice, which mellows slowly allowing burnt tobacco, seasoned oak, caramel, and a touch of leather to crescendo. It turns dry, with oak and cinnamon spice dominating the finish. The finish is exceptional, lingering long after the sip and leaving you craving more.","25th Anniversary doesnât break barriers with any of its credentials on paper, and thatâs a good thing as far as Iâm concerned. Beam didnât push the envelope on age, excessively high proof, or anything else outside the box with this release. Thereâs no crazy story here either - even the company press release describes it as âthe truest expression of Knob Creekâs iconic flavor,â which is basically saying itâs within the range of their standard flavor profile. Presumably there was more care in selecting the barrels, and pushing the age just a few years beyond the norm is proof positive of what a few more years in the barrel can do for a high proof Knob Creek Single Barrel. No doubt there are special one-off Knob Creek single barrels out there that may top this, but chances of finding one are going to be slim.","When it comes to value, limited release bourbons should always give you pause. Is it really a better whiskey? Is it more valuable because itâs limited? Is the main factor driving your interest simply a fear of missing out?Last year the Knob Creek 2001 Limited Edition bourbons were released in five batches - Eric reviewed the first three of them. While I generally agree with his overall conclusion, which is that the batches were good but not spectacular, the fact remains that I still preferred the standard Knob Creek Single Barrel over 2001. Itâs generally found in the low $40 range and readily accessible, so what would draw me to a lesser bourbon that comes with a higher price? The challenge for a brand with a great always available and affordable product is a tough one - how do you offer a limited release that tops it?Fortunately, 25th Anniversary is exactly what a limited edition Knob Creek should be. It builds off their already fantastic Single Barrel bourbon by keeping a similar flavor profile and adding dimension while rounding out the edges and maintaining potency. Knob Creek is good at 100 proof, but itâs great at 120 proof in its standard Single Barrel form. Giving us just a little more by releasing this at barrel proof was a smart move. Pushing the envelope on age without going too far keeps 25th Anniversaryâs flavor profile in line with the bold flavor Knob is known for, as opposed to entering potentially over-oaked territory and leaning heavily on higher age as a crutch to justify value. While the price of 25th Anniversary is multiples of the standard Single Barrel, it would be unrealistic to expect the experience to be multiples better as well. Instead, we get nuanced dimension and depth, pioneering into that small space of âbetterâ that exists above an already exceptional brand. Youâll have to decide for yourself if itâs worth that much more for a bourbon thatâs only slightly better, but those with the extra money to spend will be rewarded with a satisfying limited release.",June 2017,Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Bourbon
125, (Straight)* Rye,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,119.6,NAS (Press materials indicate 9 years), $70 (2018),"Sweet vanilla and honey are enveloped in warming spices with a nice intensity. If I inhale just the right way, thereâs a good amount of heat that digs its way into my nostrils making it even more pronounced. This makes for a rather bold yet still quite enjoyable aroma.","Black pepper and baking spices upfront give way to sweeter flavors of brown sugar, honey, and vanilla. The higher proof is manageable and sweet flavors do well to counter the spicy pop providing balance. The mouthfeel is satisfying, but not unusually unique in any way.","It starts with a Kentucky hug, as the spicy heat fills the back of the throat and hits with a bold intensity reminding you itâs almost 120 proof. The intensity fades quickly, leaving baking spices and charred oak against brown sugar and honey. It lingers, ultimately ending on a good note.","Itâs nice to see Knob Creek expanding the rye side of their lineup, as Knob Creek Rye has always been a rye Iâve enjoyed and one Iâve found most people tend to like as well. Because of its sweetness, my assumption is there is a lot of corn in the mashbill, and it this werenât just a barely legal rye I would be surprised. The 2018 Limited Edition is the first Knob Creek Rye Iâve had thatâs over 100 proof, as I have yet to try a Knob Creek Single Barrel Select Rye which clocks in at 115 proof (also released in 2018). At 9 years, the age is relatively high for a rye, which may contribute to some of its more subtle attributes, including the balance of spicy and sweet. Itâs also unknown if Knob Creek will continue to release limited edition ryes (though Iâd put money on it that they probably will), however this one will likely still be somewhat of a one-of-a-kind in its own right as future potential releases would likely be released at different ages and no doubt at least slightly different flavor profiles.With that in mind, I canât really say there is anything about the flavor profile that really or screams unique in any sense. Instead, I have to acknowledge its balance and overall drinkability, combined with the nice intensity brought forward at its proof point of around 120...which seems to be right about where I like Knob Creek products the best.","We first wrote about this limited edition Knob Creek in our New 2018 Whiskeys article, and at the time hypothesized that it might be released at $125+ given Knob Creekâs previous history with both the Knob Creek 2001 series and Knob Creek 25th Anniversary coming in around $130. Maybe because this is a rye, or maybe because Beam is trying to aggressively expand their rye lineup and bring more positive attention to it, the suggested price of $70 is much lower than I would have anticipated.With rising prices in the bourbon (and rye) market, a lower price sets the stage for a thought provoking discussion. Does it feel like a good value solely because itâs priced less than expected? Or does it feel cheap...like itâs not worthy of a real limited edition price tag...maybe simply because itâs a rye - bourbonâs red-headed stepchild in a sense?To me $70 still feels like a reasonable price...though that comes with a caveat. Unlike other limited editions that seem to have some value just simply for what they are - their age, their story, their truly limited nature - this one seems to have more value in its flavor profile and drinkability than anything else. Itâs not one I feel has any business being collected, or sold for a profit on the secondary market. Instead, itâs just a damn good rye thatâs priced at a premium and will probably be reasonably available and hopefully opened and enjoyed by most (assuming the release numbers are similar to some of Knob Creekâs previous limited releases).On the other hand if youâre expecting it to be twice as good as the standard Knob Creek Rye because itâs twice the price, then youâll be disappointed. Itâs more refined and more robust, but the increase in overall quality is subtle. Part of Knob Creekâs problem is the high quality and value of their standard releases, which makes it hard to swallow paying two to three times more for a limited release that might be only marginally better. But thatâs the rub, and thankfully the increase isnât as much as it probably could have been, or is in many other cases when it comes to limited editions.",May 2018,Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye - 2018 Limited Edition
126, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,100,NAS, $50 (2019),"At the forefront, rich honey and oak mingle together with vanilla, leather, cinnamon, mixed dried fruit, and brown sugar hiding behind. Thereâs a surprisingly stronger amount of ethanol than expected for a 100 proof bourbon. Despite this, the nose is layered and nuanced bringing forth a really nice balance of sweet and dry flavors. Subtle, yet full of flavor - sans the stronger presence of ethanol which holds back the nose from being really great - itâs a good introduction and foreshadows whatâs to come.","While ethanol plays a prominent part in the nose, its impact on the palate is less so, and this whiskey sips as expected for a 100 proof bourbon. It has a lighter mouthfeel and one that allows you to roll it around in your mouth without impedance by the ethanol. Notes of sweet cinnamon syrup, heavy dry aged oak, sugared figs, dried peaches, and vanilla cream are prominent. Much like the nose, the palate is a nice interplay between sweet and dry flavors.","Knob Creek Quarter Oak shines the most in the finish and really distinguishes itself from regular Knob Creek in this portion of the sip. A pleasant warming heat carries through for the entire finish. The flavors are straightforward, mainly showcasing rich oak, leather, a flash of syrup, and a hint of cinnamon spice. The finish ends on a long, dry oak note topped with baked cinnamon bark,and pepper that lasts and lasts. Itâs a great way to cap the sip off.","Compared to Knob Creek Small Batch, Knob Creek Quarter Oak delivers a deeper, richer flavor profile thanks to the additional contact that the whiskey had with the quarter casks. The presence of dry oak and leather flavors and sweeter notes, in particular, a consistent cinnamon flavor that is present throughout the entire sip. Since only a small percentage (according to Beam Suntory) of the Knob that was aged in the quarter cask is blended back in with standard Knob Creek, youâre most likely getting a very skewed ratio of standard Knob Creek to Knob Creek Quarter Oak in the mix. Yet that small ratio has a large impact. One can only imagine what this would taste like if Beam Suntory released Knob Creek Quarter Oak unblended and straight to the bottle. The large amount of craft distilleries that use quarter oak barrels gives us a slight preview, and also understanding why Beam Suntory didnât go this route. Still it would be interesting to see what a fully aged Knob Creek turns into after being barrel finished in a quarter oak barrel for an additional four yer. ","Knob Creek Small Batch is a really great value for what it is at only $35. For $15 more, Knob Creek Quarter Oak delivers a nice variation from the standard small batch that seems to add a nice amount of depth to flavor. Itâs not on equal footing with some of the other limited releases that came out in 2019, however, coming in at only $50, most people wonât be bothered by this fact either. For the price though, youâre landing right in the range of a Knob Creek Single Barrel, which delivers a more robust 120 proof pour and is usually a great sip at a fantastic value. All things considered, $50 is a fair price for what Knob Creek Quarter Oak ultimately delivers.",,Knob Creek Quarter Oak Bourbon
127, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,120,9 Years, $42 (2017),"At first, you think the sip is going to be harsh because of the nose, but it surprises you with a very rich and creamy sweetness. Youâll definitely notice the 120 proof, but youâll focus more on the great flavor. The palate consists of the vanilla, maple syrup and brown sugar that the nose foreshadowed.","Hot and long lasting. Full of cinnamon, oak and leather. The sweetness from the nose and palate carries through to the end. It can be challenging at first, but very satisfying by the end.","This one is really easy to love. If youâre having a tasting and youâre not sure which bourbon to buy, this is a pretty safe bet. It might be a high proof for many people, but the flavor is hard to dislike. Even throwing a cube in it doesnât dilute the flavor very much.  I have yet to have this with someone who disliked it. That in itself makes it pretty unique. On paper, this is simply a single barrel, higher proof version of the normal Knob Creek, yet it's far superior to it in every way. The higher proof allows the rich Knob Creek flavors to really shine.","Although it doesnât say âbarrel proofâ on the bottle, few would decry if you called it that. Most barrel proof bourbons are priced over $50. This a 120 proof single barrel that ranges in price between $38 - $45 making it a fantastic deal. This can easily be your go-to mid range bourbon based on the price and availability.","This is one of the easiest drinking high proofers. The sweet, flavorful palate is very addicting making it very easy to put down a few of these. I tasted this with a few friends of different degrees of bourbon tasting experience and everyone couldnât get enough. Even the newbie, not used to high proof bourbon, loved it. Itâs a very accessible bourbon that has a pleasant taste and is just layered enough to hold your interest. Youâll find a lot to love with this one and why it made our âBest $40-$50 bourbonsâ list.",Ongoing,Knob Creek Single Barrel Bourbon
128, Straight Rye,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,100,NAS, $40,"For supposedly being a little over 51% rye, the nose is surprisingly expressive and more inline with higher percentage rye whiskeys. Fresh cracked rye grain, green apple, and charred oak mingle together. Additionally, thereâs an underlying layer of smokey syrup present. For a 100 proof rye, the nose is layered full of flavor.","Light amounts of rye grain, white pepper, citrus rinds, vanilla, pine effervescence, and oak are noticeable. The sip is light overall for a rye. It is ever so slightly spicy and not the most rye-forward sip by any means. That said, its 100 proof makes this easy to sip on and enjoy without being too hot.","Light rye spice, sweet vanilla, and oak are present at the start. The finish has a small amount of heat upfront that fades away leaving a layer of light rye and tannic oak that linger for a while. Itâs a nice way to end the sip, albeit it doesnât leave a memorable experience behind either.","Knob Creek Rye wonât jump out in a crowded field of ryes. It isnât a unique barrel finished rye like Angelâs Envy Rye, a fruitier rye like Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond, or a heavy-handed rye-forward whiskey like High West Double Rye. What it is, is a readily available rye that will scratch most peopleâs itch when theyâre seeking out an everyday sip or a strong backbone for rye inspired cocktails. Not every whiskey can stand out from the pack and some are just content simply offering a solid pour. In this case Knob Creek Rye is about as middle of the road as you can get in terms of uniqueness.","While the flavor profile may not be overly memorable, Knob Creek Ryeâs value is hard to beat. For $40 or less, youâre able to get a very easy sipping rye that isnât overly sweet and holds back on being extremely rye forward. The lower price point allows this to easily be used in cocktails just as much as it does for pouring a glass neat.",,Knob Creek Straight Rye
129, Straight Rye,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,100,NAS, $45 (2019),"Oak, rye grain, and baked oats are at the forefront. Lingering behind are hay, muted vanilla, and sweet sugar scents. A layer of ethanol is present bringing a noticeable overlay of heat to the nose. The effect allows the nose to be nicely balanced, though slightly hot for the proof.","Rye spice, vanilla, and smoky oak quickly appear with white pepper and light anise hiding in the background. The double barrel effect is in full play in the palate as a noticeable underlying level of sweetness is present. This doesnât come as a surprise as a deeply charred second barrel typically delivers this effect. While the nose may have shown some heat, the palate is an easy sip and readily allows you to roll it around your mouth to dissect the flavors. It adds a nice twist to your average rye experience.","The sweet sugars carry through to the finish and combine with a low simmering heat that is present throughout. Sweet vanilla and oak kick things off and quickly fade to a drier leathery oak combo that lingers for a while. Itâs not your traditional rye finish, but in line with the rest of the sip, albeit delivering a slightly weaker experience than the nose and palate.","Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye is definitely sweeter than your normal rye experience. The sweetness however doesnât come across as fruity as what Iâve found in other sweeter ryes like Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond or Pinhook Bourbon n Rye. Instead, the sweetness comes across from the double barrel process, which for a rye, is rarely if ever seen. Beam knew exactly what they were doing when using a heavier level 4 char for the second barrel. This sweetness adds a nice contrasting play with the rye grain, and delivers an end result that is certainly interesting. Itâs not the most unique tasting rye Iâve ever tasted, however it does bring a certain newness to the rye category from those extra sugary flavors delivered by the double barrel process. ","In theory, $45 for a limited release is about as good as it gets nowadays. Outside of Beam, there arenât too many major distilleries pricing their limited editions this inexpensively, with perhaps Barton 1792âs recent limited releases readily coming to mind. Whereas the recent 2018 Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye was priced at double the cost of a regular Knob Creek Rye, Twice Barreled Rye is only $10-$15 more.That said, a low price alone doesnât necessarily deliver a great value either. The flavors, while unique, are also not your typical rye flavors, which may turn some people off. For the price, I was expecting a more intricate play between the spice and sweetness found in the sip. At $45 itâs priced where it should be, but I wouldnât recommend paying more than MSRP for this release either. ",,Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye
130, Straight Bourbon	 ,Heaven Hill	,Heaven Hill,92,NAS,,"Soft with an array of summer fruits: orange, apricot, and peach combined with a sweet sugarcane note. Light cinnamon also comes into play. The scents are inviting but not rich in delivery.","A delicate cinnamon spice pops at first, with baking spices and nutmeg in tow. Honey sweetness contrasts the spice notes. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side, but not so much it detracts from the experience. Despite the presence of some spice notes, the sip is quite tame, approachable, and enjoyable overall.","Cinnamon and honey carry over into the finish, and are joined by a sweet maple sugar note. Warming and medium in length, it caps the sip off nicely, maintaining the overall balance presented by this bourbon.","While the numbers are growing, bourbons with wheat as the secondary grain are still in the minority. The most popular and large production (relatively speaking) mainstays are Makerâs Mark and W.L. Weller. There are, and have been, limited release bourbons that utilize wheat as the secondary grain as well, with the Old Rip Van Winkle lineup which includes Pappy Van Winkle bourbons being the most popular. Heaven Hill also recently introduced a premium semi-annual Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond bourbon, which retails north of $100. Iâm leaving off a few for sure, but the most prevalent growth in the wheated bourbon category is from craft distilleries, of which they have seen only limited distribution. Itâs been argued that few can actually decipher whether a bourbon contains wheat as the secondary grain as opposed to the much more widely utilized rye when tasted blind. In fact, itâs not uncommon to pull out the lighter sweeter notes from those rye-based bourbons since corn, the main ingredient in every bourbonâs mashbill by law, offers up a good deal of sweet notes on its own.Narrowly focusing on the mashbill, Larcenyâs most direct âwheatedâ competition is Makerâs Mark, considering the W.L. Weller line is no longer a readily available brand. Both Makerâs and Larceny come in around the same proof (Larceny notably two proof points higher), and around the same price. Both are marketed to the masses, come in attractive packaging (though Makerâs red wax is hard to beat), and a variety of bottle sizes. By comparison, Larceny offers a more balanced experience than Makerâs in my opinion, trading a bit of character for more widespread appeal. While you will find more polarizing opinions about Makerâs Mark, I think youâd be hard-pressed to find many who actually dislike Larceny, which, all things considered, must have been what Heaven Hill was aiming for.To further support this theory, I tasted Larceny against some dated bottles of Old Fitzgerald 80 proof and 100 proof Bottled-in-Bond, and found Larceny to be the more balanced of the bunch. ","Comparing Larceny to only wheated bourbons is only a small part of the story, as it truly competes more with bourbons of a similar price than with other same grain competitors. This is especially true since the majority of consumers would not necessarily recognize, or care about, the distinction in the mashbill, simply seeing it as a means to an end and nothing more. Larceny was first announced with an average suggested price of $25 per 750 back in 2012. Itâs stayed in that range from what Iâve observed, and youâll see it float from the low $20âs up to about $30. This is generally higher than the Old Fitzgerald predecessor(s), but still a value play in todayâs marketplace. While Larceny doesnât offer a flavor profile that will wow anyone, I would argue it doesnât turn off many either. Many competitors in the same price range are arguably more polarizing, offering more obvious character in contrast with Larcenyâs balance and likeability. To that end, Larceny is an easy bourbon to recommend to anyone seeking a bourbon that errs on the sweeter side.",,Larceny Bourbon
131,  Blended Straight Whiskey,Beam Suntory,Jim Beam,128.2,NAS, $80 (2017),"Sweet and youthful on the nose. Raw grain, cornbread, and a hint of ginger are robust in their delivery. Thereâs a touch of ethanol as well, but less than expected for the proof. The aroma is more interesting than it is inviting, though itâs certainly not a deterrent.","Sweet corn and warm buttered cornbread are rounded out by rye spice and the tiniest trace of anise. Itâs lively and youthful, but doesnât taste underaged. Itâs definitely grain forward, and despite having bourbon in the blend seems to lack the traditional bourbon flavors of aged oak, caramel, and vanilla. Itâs quite intriguing, and for me enjoyable.","Medium in length and surprisingly smooth. A light pop of rye spice comes first, but quickly tapers against sweet corn and a bit of seasoned oak. This being oakâs first appearance in the flavor profile, it serves to add a layer of dimension and solidifies the presence of higher aged whiskey within the blend, though itâs still quite subtle.","Few would argue that Little Book isnât unique. In fact, thatâs probably the single thing everyone will agree on. With that being said, blends are increasingly common, and blending to a greater extent is even standard practice in some cases. In Canada, for example, they ferment, distill, age, and then blend each grain separately to arrive at the final product. As for recent releases a close comparison is Diageoâs Gifted Horse - a blend 4 year old bourbon and corn whiskey along with a 17 year old bourbon. It was met with mixed reception, but most agreed it was unusual. In his review of Gifted Horse, Eric described the different components as bringing out the worst in one another, an observation I agreed with.With Little Book, itâs interesting because the bottle isnât from a craft whiskey distillery experimenting with something new. It comes from one of Kentuckyâs major distilleries and serves to introduce the world to the companyâs next generation master distiller. It challenges the drinker, presenting a flavor profile that pushes the envelope of a traditional flavor profile. But not so far that it breaks any established barriers. While some will go so far as to find the flavor profile a bit odd, I do think there will be some who downright dislike it. With multi-whiskey-type blends, the various whiskeys can sometimes come together in a much more subdued nature than might be expected, each kind of mellowing the unique characteristics of the others. Alternatively, they can bring out the worst in one another. Fortunately, in this case the end result doesnât taste like a Frankenstein whiskey, or one that has been overly subdued. The whiskeys marry together nicely but donât overpower one another, delivering an end result thatâs uniquely different in an elegant and well-balanced way.","Little Book is a barrel proof limited edition from a major Kentucky distillery. Itâs the first edition in what is going to be an ongoing limited edition series, which means it could become a collectorâs item at some point. It presents a unique blend and unique resulting flavor profile. Even the companyâs own regularly available barrel proof product, Bookerâs Bourbon, is already pushing that price point and will be eventually eclipsing it. Take all that into account and $80 for the first ever limited release in a new series and from a major Kentucky distillery certainly seems like a bargain.But for the whiskey in the bottle the pricing might present a different story, for some at least. While I enjoy it, I think itâs going to be more polarizing than usual and many wonât be nearly as impressed with it as I am. So itâs an $80 risk, and one consumers will just need to figure out for themselves. In any event, itâs likely weâll see the price of future Little Book editions rise, and at some point many of us will look back and wish we had bought more bottles of this first edition at its MSRP, if for no other reason other than it being the first in its series.",October 2017,"Little Book ""The Easy"""

It has a light but sweet presence, with an underlying base of ethanol that cannot be ignored. While the ethanol doesnât completely detract from the experience, it prevents the whiskeyâs nose from realizing its full potential.","Ultra sweet, the sip leads with raisins and summer fruits. Butterscotch and honey further give way to a spicy rye note. Floral undertones run throughout. The palate is as playful as it is unexpected and full of flavor. Rolling around in the mouth brings forth a bit more spice, but it remains very sweet overall. Itâs incredibly light and approachable given the proof, bringing an unexpected arrangement of flavors into the picture in an enjoyable way.","A crack of spice at first, it quickly diminishes, focusing again on the sweeter flavors. Honey and butterscotch burst back into the forefront, but they trail off, transitioning from sweet to dry. The blast of more robust flavors is quick, but their presence manages to linger leaving a pleasant aftertaste.","âI created Little Book as an honor to my granddaddy, Booker and our shared love for creating unique blends to share with the world.â This phrase is written prominently on the Little Book label, signed by Freddie Noe. In the bottle this year is a blend of 8 year old Kentucky straight rye along with two Canadian whiskeys - a 13 year rye and 40 year 100% corn based whiskey.The blend percentages arenât disclosed, but coming in at 118.8 proof relative to the proofs of the three whiskeys in the blend suggests the 8 year Kentucky straight rye is potentially a high portion. It is, however, possible that itâs not. The flavor profile alludes to the possibility that Little Book Chapter 02 is an entirely different animal from a typical Kentucky straight rye, potentially a high percentage of Canadian whiskey - maybe thereâs more 40 year old 100% corn whiskey than would be assumed.","No different than Chapter 01, Little Book Chapter 02 is priced relatively low when compared to other limited releases from major Kentucky distilleries. While it is a $20 price increase over last yearâs $80 price tag, itâs still a low price for a limited release relatively speaking. Considering the polarizing flavor profile, this might still be too much for some. But considering each yearâs release will be unique, with Chapter 02 being no exception to that, itâs a reasonable price in todayâs frenzied marketplace. If I could go back, I would buy a few more Chapter 01 bottles which were readily available for a time at MSRP.

Its past chapters have included various blends that you normally wouldnât think would work well together, but do. In the case of Little Book Chapter 3, Freddie has literally done something that many bourbon drinkers probably always wanted to do, combine Beamâs Small Batch Collection into a Frankenstein blend. In this case though, Freddie took it to the next level.You assume that Little Book Chapter 3 not only is using hand-selected barrels of what are presumably some of the best âhoneyâ barrels of each of the Small Batch Collectionâs brands, but also ones consumers canât buy. With the exception of Knob Creek which has been released as a 9 year 120 proof single barrel and as a 100 proof Small Batch that recently regained its 9 year age statement, each of the expressions was pulled from aged barrels that arenât offered to consumers. Additionally and perhaps most interestingly, since the blend is being bottled uncut, it includes bourbons from the Small Batch Collection normally not offered in cask strength form. While each chapter of the series is meant to be unique, this one nails everything youâd want out of a unique bourbon. At its core, it is a high proof, bold bourbon with an enjoyable flavor profile that somehow manages to highlight the best traits of each of the Small Batch Collection brands - not a small feat mind you. More importantly however, is that itâs one that helps elevate the sum of its parts. You can call it a frankenstein bourbon or an expertly blended product, but at the end of the day, this is one of the most unique offerings utilizing current variations of products in production by a major distillery in recent times.","Little Book Chapter 3 saw a $25 dollar increase over the $100 asking price from last yearâs batch. Some may scoff at the price and say that they could just go out and buy all four bottles of the Small Batch Collection for under $200 and have four bottles of bourbon on their hands versus just one. Carrying forward that logic, one might even assume they could just experiment with a blended ratio at home to recreate Little Book Chapter 3.Except Little Book Chapter 3 contains unique Small Batch Collection barrels that aren't available elsewhere. Sure you could buy all four bottles in the Small Batch Collection and make your own blend, however you wonât be able to recreate whatâs in Little Book Chapter 3. With that in mind, the asking price of $125 seems very appropriate here, and one of the better values out their for 2019 limited releases. ",,"Little Book Chapter 3: ""The Road Home"""
134, Straight Bourbon,Diageo/Orphan Barrel Whiskey Distilling Co.,George T. Stagg Distillery,90.1,22 Years, $120,"Thereâs a good amount of oak upfront thatâs cut with a nice amount of honey, cherry, maple, and cinnamon buns. No one element overpowers the others. Its nose is not overly deep, but it does have a few layers that add a bit of complexity to it. Thereâs the hint of an amazing nose within that doesnât quite follow all the way through. I canât help but wonder how amazing the nose could be at a higher proof.","No doubt about it, this has a very oak-forward palate. At 22 years old that is to be expected, but thankfully, it doesnât suffocate the rest of the flavors. Notes of clove, cinnamon, and honey mingle in. Surprisingly, the palate doesn't taste muted as a result from the large amount of oak present, but more watered down because of the proof. Thereâs some good flavor on the palate (like many of the Orphan Barrels have), but at 90.1 proof, the flavors have a hard time standing out. You can taste that Lost Prophetâs palate has potential, which is all the more heartbreaking when it ultimately falls short.","It has a dry finish that lingers and a slight tinge of burn as it goes down. The dryness stays with you, but not to the degree the saliva-sucking Rhetoric did. The flavors blend a bit on the finish and become muddled leaving a slight tannic aftertaste. Itâs not a bad finish, but on the unspectacular side.","One the most prominent themes of the Orphan Barrel line are their high age statements. Few bourbons hit the market in any year that hover around 20 years old. Itâs said bourbon hits its sweet spot between 9-12 years, which is one reason we donât see many high-aged bourbons. The bottles that do hit are more often strikes outs than home runs. Elijah Craig 22 Year and 2013âs Eagle Rare 17 Year (really 19 years old) have been the only recent high-aged standouts for me. The first Orphan Barrel release Barterhouse, had a respectable showing last year that I donât think gets the acclaim that it deserves.As for Lost Prophet, itâs a better-balanced high-aged bourbon, but the search for the crown jewel of the Orphan Barrel line continues. The oak notes are definitely more restrained than other high-aged bourbons. This gives the other flavors in Lost Prophet a chance to shine, but unfortunately they just donât. This is by no means a bad bourbon though, itâs quite decent. You can taste the potential promise of great flavors, yet they are never quite as vivid as they should be. Simply not drowning out the palateâs flavors with oak for a high-aged bourbon is to be commended, but thatâs only half the story. The follow-through is just as important.","A bourbon needs to be more than decent for it to be worth $120, regardless of its age. Bourbons that cost north of $100 are rarely worth the money, and Lost Prophet is sadly yet another example of this. One of the main criticisms of the Orphan Barrel series is its proof point. The low 90.1 proof does the flavors a disservice. That said, there is certainly no guarantee that a higher proof would instantly make Lost Prophet better; it could even enhance the intensity of the oak flavor and completely drown out the other flavors. The odd thing about all of the bourbons in the Orphan Barrel line is the flavors all taste somewhat muted. There are many 90 proof bottles and even high-aged bottles on the market that have a much fuller flavor than this. Maybe itâs over-filtering that is the cause. If a company is going to charge this much for a bottle of bourbon then it must bring itâs âAâ game. As the fourth bottle in the Orphan Barrel series, this has to be true more than ever. Yet again, Iâm let down by an expensive, under-flavored bourbon.",December 2014,Lost Prophet Bourbon
135, Straight Bourbon,Lux Row Distillers,Undisclosed Kentucky Distillery(ies),118.4,12 Years, $150 (2019) ,"A deliciously sweet aroma of caramel, dark cherries, and sherry thatâs punctuated with seasoned oak and leather. The scents flow strongly from the glass with their boldness. The nose is warming and lavish, and is a welcoming way to start the sip.","A warm and thick mouthfeel beautifully carries the bourbonâs sweet and impressionable flavor profile. A well orchestrated rollout of cherry, plum, red wine, and pomegranate gives way to a strong oak backbone. The flavors are well paired, and its proof does well to intensify them without drowning them out. This is a delicious flavor profile that puts pure drinkability above anything else.","A bit straightforward and dry at first, its heat ramps up and leaves a delicious hot aftertaste of cherry, cinnamon, and oak that can be shockingly intense and rewarding. Big heat, strong oak, and length results in a finish that is more than it appears at first sip.","A âdouble barrelâ bourbon is a term that distilleries use very loosely and there doesnât seem to be a clear universal agreement of the term. Some distilleries use it interchangeably with âtwice-barreledâ as a way to describe a bourbon that has been put into a second barrel for finishing (e.g. Woodford Reserve Double Oaked). More recently, some distilleries have been using the term as a way to describe a marrying between two different barrels of bourbon into a micro batch (e.g. Chicken Cock 10 Year Double Barrel Bourbon). This micro batch process isnât something that has been widely used in the industry so far. As a labor intensive process, it doesn't make sense for large distilleries to attempt it - at least so far. The main reason is the processâs main selling point of curating specific barrels together is extremely hands-on and time consuming. Where single barrels can be faulted for being too unpredictable and inconsistent, and small batches faulted for their homogeneous character, Lux Row makes the case that micro batches fit in the perfect Goldilockâs Zone. It remains to be seen if Lux Row has the bandwidth to make this a repeatable limited release, or even how consistent the quality of the barrel pairings will be over the course of this yearâs release. That said, theyâre one of the first larger scale distilleries attempting this.","It would seem double barrel bourbons need to be regulated to limited release and premium priced simply based on their labor intensive process. It would be a tall order for these releases to be done on a large scale at a marginal increase in price. Even selecting and bottling single barrel bourbons is an expensive process for distilleries, usually requiring separate bottling lines dedicated to them. Now factor in the amount of time it would take just to sample, pair, and blend just two barrels together for a double barrel release, let alone the amount it will take for this 6000 bottle release, and this whole process seems daunting for a distillery to take on. Yet the fact that Lux Row Distillers Double Barrel Bourbon is priced competitively with other limited release bourbons is quite surprising and shows the company is working hard to make their mark in the industry. If Lux Row Distillers can maintain the quality level on par with the barrel pairing I tasted, this will go down as one of the best tasting limited releases this year.

136, Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Maker's Mark,94,NAS (Around 6 years), $40 (2017),"Upon lifting the glass I am greeted with the familiar Maker's profile, but with a twist. Maker's 46 nose comes across as slightly heavier and deeper than what Iâm used to from the distillery. All of the classic bourbon flavors are present, including strong hints of caramel, toasted oak, and vanilla, along with buttery toffee and a touch of fresh toasted cinnamon bread. Really pleasant with a nice amount of depth to enjoy.","The first thought that pops into my head upon tasting Maker's 46 is a kitchen on a Sunday morning. A nice buttery palate presents heavy oak, caramel, cinnamon, and light fresh baked wheat bread. The palateâs flavors arenât as deep as the nose, however itâs very well balanced and really enjoyable.","A blast of spice containing buttered rum, hints of tobacco and leather, and aged oak all greet me on the finish. It seems to liven up from the palate and presents more discernable flavor right up front. That being said, while it lingers for a while, it becomes more one dimensional, consisting mainly of light hints of tobacco and leather. Not bad, however I was hoping it would last a little bit longer since it starts off very enjoyable.","Makerâs Mark should be given credit for what theyâve done with Maker's 46. The bourbon clearly contains the soul of their standard Makerâs Mark while enhancing it in an overall positive way. While the exposure to additional charred wood has given Maker's 46 a woodier flavor profile, itâs not one thatâs overly oaked, and brings with it a nice blast of sweetness from the additional sugars from the seared French oak staves. Makerâs 46 brings takes that beloved Makerâs Mark flavor profile and amplifies it in all the right ways through a very unique twist on barrel finishing not seen elsewhere in the industry.","Maker's 46 sells for 33% more than the cost of a standard Makerâs Mark. While this may feel steep, you also have to take into account that a 33% increase is only $10 more. Do I feel like you get your moneyâs worth with Maker's 46 versus Makerâs Mark and other easily available wheated bourbons? For me, the answer is absolutely. Makerâs 46 presents a really great, rich flavor profile that you donât often see in wheated bourbons, and one that I wish the standard Makerâs Mark contained. If youâre a fan of standard Makerâs and can swing the $10 price premium, then this is a no brainer in my book.",Ongoing,Maker's 46 Bourbon
137, Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Maker's Mark,109.6,NAS (Around 6 years), $38 (375 ml) (2016),"I expected a richer and deeper experience than the standard Makerâs 46, instead Iâm greeted with something else. I assumed that the cask strength version would enhance all the scents, instead it seems to mute some, while pulling out others. The nose is comprised of rich oak, syrupy vanilla, raisins, banana bread, and an underlying scent of ethanol. A really nice combination thatâs still very enjoyable.","The palate presents a nice balance of flavors for its proof. Lots of butter, toffee, toasted sugar, and baked raisins in syrup are all noticeable, and are layered on top of an ever present base of oak. This palate is to standard Makerâs 46 as what standard Makerâs 46 is to standard Makerâs Mark; itâs sweet but not too sweet, and extremely rich and deep in flavor. It drinks more like a sub-100 proof bourbon than one thatâs almost 110 proof. It has an extremely great mouthfeel to it and is my favorite Makerâs palate to date.","Rich wood, leather, tobacco, pecans, and vanilla all lead the way of this drier finish. It offers a more sophisticated finish than I experienced with the standard version of Makerâs 46. While it is slightly hotter, itâs only a moderate increase in heat compared with the standard version of Makerâs 46. This is kind of unexpected, as this comes in at almost 20 proof points higher. After an initial blast of flavors, it finishes long with dry and woody notes.","Wheated bourbon lovers everywhere should tip their hats to the fact that Makerâs has now introduced two wheated barrel proof products to the market within the last two years. This is one category that is severely underpopulated, with William Larue Weller being the most well-known barrel proof wheated bourbon available to consumers prior to Makerâs Mark Cask Strength and Makerâs 46 Cask Strength. I wish more distilleries would follow suit, since this is one area that that is presently lacking in the bourbon marketplace.Makerâs 46 Cask Strength does a nice job of greatly enhancing the flavors that are present in the standard version of Makerâs 46. That being said, it may not be for everyone. If youâre adverse to a woodier tasting bourbon you may want to shy away as the extra exposure to wood staves is really amplified in the cask strength version. This results in a much richer, deeper drinking experience, and a flavor profile that is really quite unique.","A recent trend a lot of distilleries are embracing, is releasing special gift shop only bottlings as 375 ml products. While this might seem like a good way to allow more individuals access to limited edition products, distilleries are also using it as an excuse to upcharge customers. At $38 for a 375 ml bottle, youâre paying about the same price as a standard bottle of Makerâs 46 for half the amount of bourbon. While the flavor profile is definitely different than standard Makerâs 46, I wouldnât necessarily say itâs worth the 100% upcharge for the price of admission.",September 2015 (Ongoing at gift shop),Maker's Mark 46 Cask Strength Bourbon
138, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Marker's Mark,90,NAS, $30 (2017),"A big blast of sweetness immediately greets you with this one. Notes of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar and even a bit of strawberry are present. Itâs a surprisingly strong scent for a 90 proof bourbon. Unfortunately, right out of the bottle it also gives off a strong ethanol smell that thankfully dissipates over time and further reveals its sweet core. Itâs a very nice start that surprised me on how enjoyable it is.","Decidedly less sweet than the nose alludes to, but nevertheless still pleasant and unassuming. Notes of toffee, vanilla, and oak are most prevalent with fainter hints of toasted nut and cinnamon. Overall it has a thin but buttery mouthfeel that goes down smooth. Enjoyable but not mindblowing.","At first, the thinness of the bourbon makes the finish almost nonexistent, but then it comes bouncing back. I wouldnât necessarily call the finish hot, but I wouldnât call it meek either. The palateâs flavors that carry over to the finish are by no means deep and layered, but overall theyâre pleasant and hard to find fault with.","At this point in the game, Makerâs Mark and bourbon have become synonymous with one another. Go to any bar in America and ask for a bourbon. If you donât get Jim Beam, youâre getting Makerâs (also owned by Beam Suntory). A lot of this is due to Makerâs being the companyâs sole product for 50+ years. It might be a stereotype, but anything that's extremely mainstream often isnât also described as unique. This is one case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The usual flavors suspects are all present here, but itâs the final product that tastes uniquely Markerâs. The combination of rotating aging barrels and a wheated mashbill with an above average amount of malted barley creates a very sweet palate that stands out from most bourbons on the market.Of course the red wax dipped bottle is its most recognizable physical trait, and although many competitors are also using wax, Makerâs Mark holds a trademark on their wax drip, which is why theyâre the only bourbon on the shelf with it. You donât get to be where Makerâs is by throwing curveballs. Simply, itâs a down-the-middle bourbon and will appeal to just about anyone. Itâs hard to truly hate it based on its taste, but itâs also not out of this world unique enough to truly love it either.","As with almost all bourbons, prices have gone up in the past few years and Makerâs Mark hasnât been able to escape this. Once exclusively below $30, that is no longer the case. Larger liquor stores that buy it in bulk still price Makerâs at the âold price,â but those days are fading. As Makerâs approaches the $30 range, I begin to question its overall value. Often times Makerâs is used as a mixing bourbon, but this increase in price is, well...pricing the bourbon right out of that category. As a $30 sipping bourbon, the lack of depth on the palate also hurts it in this price range.As it stands, Maker's is arguably priced right on the edge of fair and overpriced. If the price continues to rise, there are just too many great sub-$30 options to justify buying a bottle of Markerâs Mark. Considering the introduction of more premium bottlings including Maker's 46, Maker's Cask Strength, and Maker's 46 Cask Strength (arriving in late 2015), it seems Beam is diversifying the Maker's brand to keep it from appearing stale, a divergence from 50+ years of literally offering one single bottling. But what does this mean for the standard Maker's? With premium bottlings priced only moderately higher, the standard Maker's price appears even more out of balance.",Ongoing,Maker's Mark Bourbon
139, Straight Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Marker's Mark,113.2,NAS," $40 (375 ml), $55 (750 ml) (2017)","Nice full-bodied mouth feel that coats your tongue. Notes of caramel, toasted nuts and cinnamon provide a wonderfully flavored sip. Deeper hints of allspice, dark fruit and a touch of molasses round it out. The palate also follows the standard Makerâs flavor profile, but it has much more life in it.","Medium to long finish that has a great mix of sweet and spicy. They play off each other nicely as they keep the high and lows in check. The tail end of the finish concludes with earthy tones. It may be on the low end of proof for a cask strength bourbon, but it still packs a decent amount of heat. Adding a few drops of water did help cut the heat and allowed me to focus more on the great flavors.","This is the first time Makerâs Mark has ever offered its product in cask strength form. It has a similar style as Old Weller Antique (107 proof) and Old Grand Dad 114 (114 proof), although Makerâs Cask Strength does a better job keeping the spice in check. The sweetness has more of a presence and helps it from being more one sided like the aforementioned bourbons.It is also one of the few barrel proof wheaters on the market. It may not be as potent as the 130-plus proof William Larue Weller, but it captures some of that rare bourbonâs best traits. High proof wheaters have a great interplay between sweet and spicy flavors that you donât always find in corn or rye heavy barrel proof bourbons. Simply put, theyâre delicious to sip.","Makerâs was wise to soft-release this new version of their flagship bourbon in 375 ml bottles at their gift shop and slowly expand nationwide. With few barrel proof wheaters on the market, and company claims over the last few years of shortages, this allowed more bottles to get to more consumers. With 750 ml bottles now available nationwide for a respectable $55 price, consumers can now get their hands on a great product they have been clamoring for. Despite the proof being on the low side for a barrel proof bourbon, its competitive price and great flavors allow it to keep company among some of the best barrel proof bourbons on the market.","Credit must be given to Makerâs Mark that they finally listened to their customersâ plea for a higher proof and therefore, more flavorful Makerâs Mark bourbon. You can find Makerâs Mark in every bar, but I canât tell you the last time I ordered one. The bourbon is too thin and the flavor too weak and bland for me to ever show any interest in it. Makerâs Mark Cask Strength goes a long way in correcting those faults. It is now on my radar, not because itâs a new exciting bourbon, but because the flavor now raises the bourbon to a higher level.",Ongoing,Maker's Mark Cask Strength Bourbon
140, Bourbon,Beam Suntory,Maker's Mark,112.5,NAS (Around 6 years), $80 (2017),"Surprisingly approachable even though itâs clocking in at over 110 proof. Toffee, rich vanilla, toasted oak, a dash of coffee, freshly baked hot cross buns, and the slightest hint of ethanol all waft up. It has just enough depth to differentiate itself from any other Makerâs nose Iâve experienced in the past, and provides for an enjoyable start to this bourbon.","It provides a surprising contrast from the sweetness that the nose delivers. An initial burst of sweet vanilla, corn, and light dried raisins is quickly replaced with spicy black pepper, wheat, and oak. These flavors are all encapsulated by the heat that was missing from the nose, as this bourbon starts to beat its chest and remind you that it is cask strength after all.","The heat carries through from the palate into a finish that is the driest part of the sip. Dry leather, old wood, and a hint of tobacco play out amongst the heat. The wood and tobacco quickly drop off leaving just dry tannic leather that is eventually joined with a fresh cut grass aftertaste. Itâs a weird combination that lingers for a remarkably long time. Certainly not the note I was expecting to end on.","By default, nearly every Private Select bottling is going to be unique. With over a 1,000 combinations and various proof combinations, the uniqueness possibility is astounding. For example, Makerâs 46 Cask Strength was created from the inclusion of 10 Makerâs 46 staves. Change those 10 staves out for new types of oak staves, and you open up all sorts of flavor profiles for this line.Itâs clear that this Spring 2017 edition was born as a Makerâs Mark bourbon with many of the brandâs classic characteristics evident, however the finishing staves manage to alter the profile in a pretty impactful way. Itâs really a neat concept by the somewhat conservative Makerâs that allows for flavor variation, while still remaining close to their core product.The challenge with this line is that each bottle will be a gamble since every barrel dump will be unique due to the extreme finishing possibilities. This also acts as a double edged sword. Just because something is inherently unique, doesnât mean that its quality will always match. This Spring 2017 edition is a clear example of this. The flavor profile doesnât wow and itâs hard to tell why. Is it the specific combination of the staves, the proof it was bottled at, or the fact it may have started as just a mundane Makerâs Mark barrel? Itâs hard to say, but itâs clear that uniqueness can lead to great results, as evidenced by the Makerâs Mark 46 Cask Strength bottle I reviewed.","Makerâs has decided to carry through its initial pricing of the 375ml bottles of Makerâs Mark 46 Cask Strength and sell this 750ml bottle for $80. This makes Private Select bottles the priciest non-limited edition Makerâs Mark bottles to date. There is certainly higher degree of handling due to the bespoke finishing of each barrel that accounts for the $80 price, but that price also doesnât come with a guarantee. Once again the uniqueness factor and the somewhat randomness of stave selection comes into play here. If you have a favorite liquor store that you often like to buy store picks from, itâs probably a safer bet to try a Private Select bottling theyâve done. If you go in blind when purchasing a bottle, knowing the high degree of flavor variations with these releases, possibly more so than other single barrel finishes, itâs a true gamble with every bottle you buy.",Spring 2017,Maker's Mark Private Select Gift Shop Spring 2017
141, Straight Corn Whiskey,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,100,NAS, $12 (2017),"A youthful corn-filled scent fully envelops my glass. Along with the corn, a healthy dose of vanilla, sweet plantains, and light oak are layered in. The slightest hint of ethanol is also present. The nose is far from impressive, and I would be shocked to think this is anything older than 2 years if I didnât already know it to be 4 years old based on BiB label requirements.","Corn, rich vanilla, dried banana chips, toasted oak, and mixed nuts are all present and easy to pick out thanks to a light mouthfeel. As the name suggests it is quite mellow, which is likely a result of the high corn mashbill combined with being aged in used Heaven Hill barrels. Despite the 100 proof, itâs quite manageable, which allows me to roll this around my mouth for a while trying to pick out flavors. However come to find out itâs not really necessary, since the palateâs overall flavor profile errs on the simple side. Thatâs not necessarily a bad thing though, since its flavor profile, while mediocre, is still enjoyable.","This uncomplicated finish consists of vanilla and corn as the predominate flavors, followed only by the slightest hint of fruit juice. The finish contains a small amount of heat up front, but itâs the corn aftertaste that continues to dance in my mouth for quite a while after each sip.","Corn whiskey isnât a new concept and neither is Mellow Corn. In fact, Mellow Corn has been around as a BiB corn whiskey since 1945, however itâs only been the last few years that people really started giving Mellow Corn notice.Part of the recent attention is due to its low price point, but also due to the recent trend of well known craft distillers getting into the corn whiskey game. These include more well known names such as Tuthilltown Spirits with their Hudson Corn Whiskey, and Balcones with their Baby Blue Corn Whisky and True Blue Corn Whisky. While not everyone enjoys a high corn mashbill, I find it to be a nice break from so many traditional heavier rye and wheated whiskeys and bourbons on the market, and itâs nice to see younger distilleries pay tribute to this style of whiskey too.Compared to Balcones True Blue Corn Whiskyâs flavor profile, Mellow Cornâs is nowhere near as deep. Then again, True Blue Corn Whisky is barrel proof, bottled at 116.6 proof. Sure Mellow Cornâs flavor profile is a lot shallower by comparison, but it also sells for over four times less, and that right there is what makes Mellow Corn so unique. While many craft distillers are selling young corn whiskey for $45 or more, Mellow Corn is a decent tasting inexpensive BiB corn whiskey aged in used Heaven Hill barrels that wonât break the bank.","Most of the time when youâre paying around $12 for a whiskey, you expect that youâre going to get some bottom shelf swill - and normally youâd be right for thinking that. However, the great thing about Mellow Corn being labeled a BiB whiskey is that youâre guaranteed to be drinking at least a 4 year old 100 proof whiskey. Now this doesnât mean it will be the best thing you ever tasted, but it does afford you a bit of hope that what youâll try will be better than what you might normally expect for the price. And in this case, thatâs exactly what youâre getting. For only $12, Mellow Corn delivers a different experience to whiskey drinkers, that while not the best, is certainly far from the worst.Think about that for a second. For $12 youâre getting a unique whiskey that affords you an experience you normally wouldnât have everyday thanks to its 90% corn mashbill, BiB designation, and aging in used Heaven Hill barrels. Compared to other corn whiskeys on the market, and even other bottom shelf whiskeys, itâs practically a steal for what youâre getting. For that price alone itâs worth picking up and trying a bottle just to see what you think.",Ongoing,Mellow Corn Whiskey

It reminded me of inhaling a fresh uncooked pizza about to go into a wood fired oven. Compared to the normal Michterâs US*1 Bourbon, the nose is much more prominent. The nose was so strong, that the moment I poured this bourbon into my glass sitting on the table I could smell it.","Honey, vanilla and light caramel jumped out at me with a subtle hint of smoke quickly appearing as I took that first sip. While not as sweet as their normal bourbon, itâs a very pleasant palate that seems a bit more refined than what you find in a sip of regular Michterâs US*1 Bourbon.","Surprisingly a strong sense of smoked wood was very present at the start of this finish, which reminded me of a light scotch in a sense. The smoke faded away and turned into aged oak, leather, and light traces of pepper, which ramped up in heat the longer the finish went on. Unlike the regular Michterâs US*1 Bourbon, this finish seemed to linger in my mouth for a while which was a really pleasant surprise.","While I find the normal Michterâs US*1 Bourbon tastes like it hasnât spent much time in the barrel, the additional 26 days in a toasted oak barrel made a world of difference to this bourbon. I was really surprised at how much of a smoky overall flavor profile this bourbon took on. While other distillers have finished their bourbon in either new charred oak barrels (Woodford Double Oaked) or in used wine barrels (High West, Heaven Hill, etc.), this is the first time I can recall a bourbon being barreled in a toasted barrel. Unlike normal charred oak barrels that are exposed to high heat for a short burst of time of a minute or less, these barrels were exposed to heat via the burning of the same wood that comprised the staves on the barrel itself. This unique long exposure to a lower heat really imparted a nice flavor profile on this bourbon.","This bourbon is priced at a premium of $50 which is usually the going rate for a barrel finished bourbon these days, no matter the distiller. That being said, I find the normal Michterâs at $40 to be overpriced by about $15. While good, I still have the same feelings on this Toasted Barrel Finish release and feel this is more in line with a $40 Bourbon.Itâs a fine bourbon, and certainly better than the normal Michterâs. However, if I were to spend $50 on a bottle of bourbon, Iâd sooner recommend a bottle of Blantonâs for the same price or Elijah Craig 12 or Four Roses Single Barrel for much less.

Sweet corn, honey, and vanilla are immediately noticeable when you take a sip. The palate comes off as that of a young whiskey that hasnât spent a lot of time in the barrel.","The finish is light and lingering. Notes of oak, white pepper, honey, peaches and raisins lingered for a while in my mouth with the predominant flavor being the white pepper that brings a subtle heat and spice to the finish.","This bourbon tastes like many young bourbons Iâve had from start-up distilleries with its light nose and sweet palate profile.

In fact, since Michterâs does not provide an age statement and is not very straightforward about the distillery source for this bourbon, it could very well be a young product that is being bottled and sold.","Sure the bourbon tastes fine, but I can name a lot of bourbons that are just âfineâ or above average for under $40. Several better values come to mind, including Eagle Rare 10 year, Four Roses Single Barrel, and Elijah Craig 12, to name just a few. A better price point for this bourbon would be $25 - thatâs more of a fair value in my book for what you get for your money.",Ongoing,Michter's US*1 Bourbon
144, Straight Rye Finished in Sherry Casks,Limestone Branch Distillery Co.,"MGP Ingredients, Inc.",90,2 Years, $50 (2018),"The aroma is soft on entry, but thereâs a lot going on. Sweet summer fruits, floral notes, and a hint of rye spice are most prominent. It has a familiar MGP rye nose, but with additional complexity brought by the fruit and floral notes. Itâs enjoyable and well developed.","Like the aromas the sip is also soft on entry, with cherry, raisin, and caramelized sugary notes first. A touch of rye spice along with an almost port-like flavor round out the backend. Being a finished rye, the sherry cask finish seems to become more evident here. Itâs gentle and easy to drink, with a well-rounded and nicely integrated flavor profile.","A little pop of spice starts things off, followed by a reinvigoration of the sweet fruit and sugary notes found in the palate. The sweetness lingers, but itâs soft and subtle right until the end. Overall itâs quite good.","Minor Case Rye is a very soft, easy to sip whiskey. Itâs layered and nuanced but very subtle at the same time, much like the experience I find with Hillrock Estateâs Solera Aged Bourbon. At two years old, itâs quite young but that youth is well hidden by its flavor profile. Itâs a trend Iâm starting to notice more and more with two year old ryes, as many just donât taste anywhere near as young as Iâd expect. Based on tasting, my assumption is the sherry cask finishing not only mellows out this whiskeyâs rough edges, but adds additional depth to the flavor profile as well.Barrel finishing, including sherry cask finishing, is becoming increasingly popular. I havenât had every sherry finished bourbon or rye, and did not have any sherry cask finished ryes available in-hand to directly compare. But direct comparisons aside, compared to rye whiskey at large Minor Case Rye does succeed in separating itself from the herd, offering a more layered and softer drinking experience than youâd typically find.","Simply talking technicals, at only two years the age will surely put up red flags for some people. But that aside, additional time in sherry casks combined with what I can only assume was a combination of quality craftsmanship and highly skilled tasters, the final product is a good one. Iâm also a sucker for fanciful bottles, and the extra care put into this one helps make it feel premium, even if it doesnât make the whiskey taste any different. To that end, at $50 itâs not a bargain whiskey, but a bit of a splurge. It will probably surprise most at how complex and well integrated it is, especially considering its age. Donât expect a flavor bomb, but if youâre looking for something thatâs subtle and a little different from much of what might be on your shelves, Minor Case Rye delivers. If youâre looking for a plain old bargain whiskey or still exploring new flavor profiles in the âeverydayâ whiskey area, Iâd recommend putting your resources there instead.",February 2017 / Ongoing Annual Release,Minor Case Rye - Sherry Cask Finished - 2017
145, Straight Rye,New Riff Distilling,New Riff Distilling,100,NAS (Aged at least 4 years), $45,"Surprisingly smokey, the nose starts with charred oak, flamed orange peel, oats, and the faintest hints of vanilla and burnt caramel. These aromas all mingle with an underlying sense of smokieness and a light layer of ethanol. Itâs a fantastic start to the sip, drawing you in and making you wonder if itâll taste as unique as it smells.","The whiskey has a light and silky mouthfeel, yet one that still delivers plenty of flavor. Spicy and sweet, with orange zest, black pepper, tobacco leaf, and touches of honey and vanilla are also noticeable. Rye spice comes in large waves as I swirl the sip around my mouth. ","A hot fiery finish ends the sip. Bold rye spice and a peppery blast are found at the start. This spiciness lingers and is mixed in with a pleasing amount of heat. Though enjoyable, the finish isnât as diverse as the nose and palate, and also carries a hint of youth to it. These factors make it come off as the weaker part of the overall sip in comparison.","New Riff takes a refreshingly new approach with their product. It seems like they distinctly tried to merge old tradition with new ways of  bringing this product to market. While not the first distillery to wait until their own distillate was aged the required four years and could be released as Bottled in Bond - Wilderness Trail also went this route - New Riff is part of the small club to do so, and does so with all of their current standard whiskey products. Additionally, the fact that they chose to do no chill filtration will appeal to many in the whiskey community. Top all of this off with a well designed embossed glass bottle and a sleek black synthetic cork, and New Riff Rye stands out from the crowd.Package design and distillation choices only go so far however. In the end itâs whatâs in the bottle that counts. In this case, New Riff delivers a solid contender. With little youth present in the sip, it delivers flavor profile that is easy to enjoy and full of depth. Itâs not quite as well rounded as say Pikesville Rye 6 Year, however itâs spicy bold flavor profile helps it stand out from the pack of its rye competitors.","Coming in at $45 seems like a great bargain nowadays for a full flavored whiskey. That is until you realize that rye, with a few exceptions, isnât as crazy as the bourbon is in the market. While $45 is relatively inexpensive in the grand comparison of the whiskey world, it still puts New Riff Rye at the higher end of our Best Rye Whiskeys list. Its unique traits from a technical standpoint donât carry over to help here either, as New Riff Rye isnât the only Bottled in Bond rye on the market. The long standing crowd favorite Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond, can be had with little effort and at only two-thirds of the price. For a newer distillery however, the price is a nice start. Usually with a young upstart like New Riff, you have an outrageous price tag that makes you second guess buying a bottle from an unproven distillery. New Riff helps break that mold though and even with a $45 price tag, delivers a well-rounded, fair-valued rye.",,New Riff Kentucky Straight Rye
146, Straight Bourbon,New Riff Distilling,Sourced from MGP,97.7,10 Years, $46 (2018),"Not as in-your-face as some of the high rye bourbons that are distilled at MGP, however itâs still clear upon smelling this that O.K.I is an MGP bourbon. Upon bringing the glass to my nose Iâm immediately greeted with rye spice and leather mixed with peaches. These are further mixed with light butterscotch, vanilla, coffee beans, whipping cream, and baked pie crust. The mixture of the rye spice with the prominent sweeter notes creates a pleasant combination.","A dose of rye spice is mixed with cinnamon, peaches, white pepper, and new oak along  with a hint of summer berries. There is a subtle yet enjoyable heat to the palate. While the flavors are easy to pick out and enjoy, its lightness and lack of mouthfeel prevents it from truly taking off. Instead itâs just an average palate, no different from so many other MGP bourbons currently on the market.","In a word, lacking. Itâs slightly dry with rye spice, oak, leather, and green pepper at the start. Those flavors quickly fade to just drier oak, which lasts a short amount of time before fading out.","Bravo to New Riff for the level of transparency they provide with their O.K.I. brand. The company is completely honest about the fact that while they age the barrels and select them when they feel ready, they donât distill the mash that goes into this brand. In fact, they even incorporated this truth right into the name. In a bourbon world full of convoluted backstories and marketing gimmicks, itâs still nice to see transparency take center stage for some brands. Transparency aside, O.K.I. 10 Year doesnât stand out from the rest of the crowd, MGP sourced or not. Its flavor profile is pleasant overall, but it just doesnât deliver anything new or distinctive to the consumer. While thereâs nothing wrong with being able to enjoy a bourbon in the moment, thereâs something to be said to also aim to deliver a memorable experience too. In this sense, O.K.I. misses the mark.","A few years ago, paying nearly $50 for a 10 year bourbon from MGP would have seemed too rich for my blood. Especially considering all the great age stated bourbons at the time such as Eagle Rare 10 Year Single Barrel, Elijah Craig 12 Year, Knob Creek Single Barrel 9 Year, and Henry McKenna 10 Year. However the market looks quite different than it did a few years ago. Eagle Rare lost its single barrel designation, and Elijah Craig and Knob Creek lost their age statements. Sure Henry McKenna 10 Year is still available and is a fantastic value, but thatâs the exception to the norm nowadays.Today a 10 year age stated bourbon for under $50 seems like a rarity. While I would have liked a more mature flavor profile to be delivered for a bourbon aged 10 years, I also donât regret spending the money I did to buy a bottle of O.K.I. 10 Year, especially considering it will no longer be in production soon. I would caveat to anyone who is considering buying this that there are certainly better bourbons out there for under $50, however if your game is age stated bourbons no matter the flavor profile, O.K.I. 10 Year surely delivers.",Ongoing,O.K.I.  10 Year Bourbon
147, Bourbon,Michelone Reserve,Middle West Spirits,90,NAS, $50 (2014),"Picking up OYO for the first time, I was completely underwhelmed by what I smelled. Upon first (and second, and third, and fourth) whiff I was hit with a light alcohol scent mixed with rubber. If I was judging what bourbon to drink based on smell alone, I would pass on this every time.","The palate makes up for the nose. On the first taste, my mouth was hit with a super sweet wheat taste. The sugars from the wood really come out in OYO and it makes you wish that you were pairing it with ice-cream or fudge. Unfortunately, the thin palate disappears just as youâre starting to appreciate the sweet taste of this bourbon.","OYO has a really light, but long dry finish of new wood and leather. It lingered in my mouth for awhile as I debated what to make of this bourbon. On one hand, the nose does nothing for you, yet the palate is actually quite enjoyable that's followed by a finish which seems to be a ""take it or leave it type."" As I drank my glass, I went back and forth from liking the finish a lot to just finding it to be so-so.","Iâm a fan of small distilleries, especially ones that are starting up in cities outside of Kentucky and Indiana. You get to see how grains and water from different parts of the country impact the final product. In this case, you also get to see how well a small distillery in Columbus, OH blends their wheated whiskey with a Kentucky straight bourbon.Middle West Spirits has done a good job at producing this product. The blend of their whiskey made from Ohioâs soft red winter wheat with a Kentucky straight whiskey works well. Theyâve delivered a very drinkable bourbon that most first-time bourbon drinkers can drink neat and enjoy.","Like most small distilleries this bourbon is priced higher than itâs worth. I realize that costs must be covered, but at $50 a bottle of bourbon should make me look forward to the next glass. Instead OYO has left me pondering how long it will take me to drink this bottle, as it just doesnât jump out and beg me to drink more.Ironically, after doing this review, I poured myself a second glass to pair with some fudge which worked quite nicely together. The sweet palate of the bourbon was enhanced by the super sweet chocolate fudge.  If it sold for $20 less, Iâd recommend it as a bottle to have on hand to pair with desserts. At $50 a bottle itâs a hard sell.",2012 / Ongoing,OYO Bourbon
148, Straight Bourbon,Willett Distillery,Willett Distillery,100,NAS, $22 (2017),"Notes of molasses, caramel, mint, and cherry cough syrup are delivered in a straightforward way. Its youthfulness is moderately noticeable on the nose as some chemical notes pop in and out, but they arenât detrimental to the overall package. The nose just isnât very memorable as its positive and even its negative characteristics donât leave a lasting impact one way or the other. It largely comes down to the lack of intensity of the scents that hold this back and keep it from reaching even middle of the road levels.","Itâs surprisingly thin, both in consistency and flavor. Notes of caramel stand out over faint notes of butterscotch and oak. The palate comes across as a bit underdeveloped and fails at providing anything of lasting interest. The palate is on the right path, but it just not quite there yet.","A low yield burn on the backend that quickly dissipates. Faint notes of clove, cinnamon, and a dash of pepper do little to bring any excitement to this bourbon. Itâs simply a very straightforward and average finish.","Prior releases of Old Bardstown consisted of sourced bourbon presumably from Heaven Hill. It wasnât a terribly exciting bourbon, but it was generally consistent. Willettâs modern day reputation of being an expert sourcer wasnât based on their Old Bardstown brand. It was due to the companyâs Family Estate single barrel bourbons and ryes that have all but disappeared from shelves beyond the distilleryâs gift shop. With the company back to distilling their own product after 40 years, this is the first taste most drinkers have had of Willettâs bourbon distillate.Since the Old Bardstown brand was never known for its exceptional quality, it makes sense for the company to offload some of their new stock early as the majority of it comes of age. This might be due to financial reasons and to continue to build excitement, however thereâs also the possibility certain barrels might not be showing enough promise. Itâs only a theory, but itâs not uncommon for companies to unload less-than-seller stock under a lower-tier brand they own.Much like Willettâs 2 and 3 year old rye whiskeys, their 4 year old bourbon definitely shows promise. For many that wonât be enough. With heightened expectations based on their name and history, many will go into Old Bardstown BiB expecting something amazing and the bourbon simply isnât there yet. Itâs an incredibly straightforward bourbon - almost shockingly so. This could be again why the company decided to release this bourbon under the Old Bardstown label and not under their own name. This bourbon shows how far the company still has to go before reaching the quality they became known for with their sourced bourbon releases.","Sometimes itâs hard to remember based on the fanfare and long history of the company, but Willett is a craft distillery. Anyone who has purchased a craft bourbon before never forgets the sticker shock that usually accompanies it. Itâs not uncommon for craft bourbons under five years old to easily cost north of $40. Despite it being their own distillate, Willett chose to keep Old Bardstown BiB priced in the same range it was when they sourced bourbon for the brand. There are most likely many reasons they were able to do that as they arenât exactly a new distillery, just one who is distilling bourbon again after a long hiatus.At $22, its priced a bit on the high side compared to many budget BiB bourbons in the marketplace. Unfortunately, it doesnât stand up flavorwise to many of these lower priced BiB bourbons, such as Old Grand-Dad, Evan Williams, and Heaven Hill. Right now Old Bardstown BiB is simply a curiosity buy. Itâs priced fair for someone seeking it out for that reason and when itâs compared to other craft bourbons on the market.",September 2016/Ongoing,Old Bardstown Bottled in Bond Bourbon
149, Straight Bourbon,"Willett Distilling Co., KBD",Undisclosed,101,NAS (Said to be 10 Years), $35 (2017),Very flat. Earthy overtones with spice and barely undertones that never reach any height.,"A bit more flavorful than the palate with more oak prevalent. Some spice and fresh herbs show up for a moment. Surprisingly, it has very little heat (and flavor) for 101 proof. It goes down easy.","The peculiar nose is what youâll notice most with this bourbon. Your sense of curiosity will spark as sherry and copper are very prevalent. It smells quite different from most bourbons, but that doesnât automatically make it a winner. The nose comes off like itâs a barrel finished bourbon, yet it isnât. For how unique the nose is, it still seems like itâs missing another key ingredient to make it great. It has far too much copper when more spice or sweetness was needed.","At $30, itâs priced on the high side for what it is. Itâs unique nose and flavor arenât quite good enough to warrant this price. Maybe at a higher proof point this would have been a more flavorful and interesting bourbon. As is, it makes you feel like youâre getting a raw deal.","If youâre a bourbon lover, this can be an interesting stop on your journey. Its nose is different enough to warrant a quick look, but not special enough to spend much time with. The palate is one of the flattest Iâve had. The finish, much like the nose can be interesting if you have a developed flavor palate to compare it to. Itâs scotch-like qualities are light but present. For some, that enough to spark interest, for most, itâs instantly forgettable.",Ongoing,Old Bardstown Estate Bourbon
150, Bourbon,Diageo/Orphan Barrel Distilling Co.,Bernheim,90,26 Years, $150 (2014),Not as sweet as the nose suggests. The oak flavor is the most dominant trait but it doesnât completely overpower the bourbon. Small amounts of dried cherries and hints of dark chocolate peek through the oak. The palate is overall light and airs more on a balanced array of flavors than hitting you with a mouthful of any one flavor. Overall the flavors are very unobtrusive.,The high age and strong (but not overbearing) oak flavors leave the bourbon with a dry finish. The medium to light finish has a flash of spice before it dissipates all too soon. This once again probably has more to do with the Orphan Barrel lineâs lower-than-average proof point than the bourbon itself. Although this one doesn't taste as watered down as Barterhouse did.,"The best thing the Orphan Barrel bourbons have going for them (beside the packaging), are their deliciously sweet smelling noses. Each one in the line has its own distinct style, and they are all great. The problem is the rest of the experience. The bourbon itself just falls short. Theyâre not bad, but theyâre not great either. Old Blowhardâs palate is interesting and has its own unique taste, but thereâs just something missing. Years ago when Parker Heritage released a 27 year bourbon they nailed it. Itâs full bodied and has a great balance of flavors with just the right amount of oak. Five years later, thereâs still nothing like it. I doubt anyone will say that five years from now about Old Blowhard.","Itâs very hard to age a bourbon 26 years and do it right. But that is Diageoâs problem, not mine. In the case of the Parkerâs 27 year bourbon, itâs a perfect example of a bourbon worth its premium price. Old Blowhard at $150 may be a decent value for its age, but not for the bourbon inside the bottle. I might be ok paying half that based on Old Blowhardâs quality. Whenever anyone releases a product, you judge the product on its own merits, but you undoubtedly have to compare it to other like products in the marketplace. At over double the price of Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, which is the true benchmark of premium bourbon and great value, Old Blowhard doesnât come close.","The current Orphan Barrel line really wants to be great bourbon, but no matter how hard they may try, it's just not going to be. All of the bourbons seem to have a good foundation and are just-above-average in uniqueness, but yet they keep coming up short. Once bourbon starts to go bad during aging, you canât magically make it better (blending aside). Diageo must have finally got to the point where they had to do something with their massive collection of random barrels from old distilleries. So then, why not slap some amazing labels on trendy shaped bottles with some snazzy marketing to help drum up excitement? The juice quality wasnât going to sell itself. They had no choice but to rely on the marketing do that job. Again, I donât think Old Blowhard and the rest of the Orphan Barrel line are bad bourbons, they're just not fantastic and worth their MSRP.",March 2014,Old Blowhard Bourbon
151,Blended Straight Bourbon,Old Elk Distillery,Three distilleries - MGP in Indiana and undisclosed distilleries in New York and Colorado,88,, $50 (2019),"Light with traces of cinnamon and cocoa which layer against traditional notes of caramel and burnt oak. While the scents are nice, theyâre very delicate necessitating a good hard inhale to eke them out.","The sip enters gently and the first thing I notice is its velvety mouthfeel. Itâs quite easy to roll around in the mouth with almost no burn, and it takes a few moments for the flavors to develop. An ever-so-light cinnamon spice comes into play, along with brown sugar, cocoa, and maple syrup. Itâs very approachable, with a contrasting viscous, velvety mouthfeel against a modest set of flavors.","The flavors crescendo, with a brief eruption of baking spice and chocolatey caramel notes. The mild intensity quickly dissipates, leaving traces of brown sugar and maple syrup sweetness against rye spice.","On the surface Old Elk might seem like just another premium priced bourbon in an elegant bottle. But digging deeper there are some interesting things about this bourbon that require a little more exploration or knowledge about the industry.The most prominent is the name scribed on the front label - Greg Metze. A veteran master distiller, Metze may just be one of todayâs most prominent distillers youâve rarely heard of. Former master distiller at MGP - the Indiana distillery behind many sourced brands along with their well-known 95% rye - Metze resigned from his role there in 2016 to venture into the bourbon consulting business. He now works exclusively with Old Elk Distillery.When Old Elk approached Metze about five years ago, the goal was to create a âsmooth and easy bourbon,â according to Metze. To accomplish this he lowered the corn content to the minimum 51% allowable for bourbon in order to make room for 34% malted barley providing sweet smooth characteristics, and 15% rye for some spice notes. At 34%, this is an unusually high amount of malted barley for a bourbon.    Old Elk has been distilled with the custom mashbill and aged in three different states before being blended and bottled in Colorado. Metze developed and produced the custom Old Elk mashbill, along with four other custom mashbills currently aging, for Old Elk during his time as master distiller at MGP in Indiana. The custom Old Elk Bourbon mashbill was subsequently produced at New York and Colorado distilleries. Each bourbon in the blend is a straight bourbon, and the reason the label states âblendedâ straight bourbon is strictly because of this, as Metze confirmed it would qualify as straight bourbon if not for the multi-state sources. But this was always only a temporary strategy to build enough stock early on, and the initial production run is now complete. As a result the existing bourbon stock continues to age, and as of November 2018 all of the inventory reached a minimum of four years old. Old Elk currently has the ability to mash, ferment, distill, and age at their distillery, and as of the end of this year their distillery and warehouse located in Fort Collins, Colorado are scheduled to be completed.Finally, there is one thing about this bourbon that really stood out to me. The marketing and conversations with Metze consistently use one word - smooth. While some critics cringe at the use of the word when describing bourbon, it is one that comes up often. We get requests on a regular basis from folks looking for âsmoothâ bourbons. Admittedly, the first word that came to mind when I sipped this was âsmooth,â and yes we joked about it. But there is something different about this bourbon, and itâs very subtle. I think this is attributed to the âSlow Cutâ proofing process they use, which is a unique and proprietary one. While proofing is typically a 24-48 hour process, Old Elkâs process takes several weeks longer. The benefit is it preserves the more delicate congeners produced during fermentation, distillation, and maturation. According to Metze, âwhen reduction water is added to barrel proof distillates, heat is liberated and can drive off high volatility congeners. By doing the reduction in many stages, rather than one or two, the amount of heat liberated is incrementally less, thus protecting the congener profile.â","Old Elk Bourbon is carefully crafted and intended to be a smooth bourbon with mass appeal. The company succeeds in that goal. At $50 it is premium priced, and its 88 proof wonât necessarily excite more die-hard enthusiasts. But this is a premium bourbon intended for the masses. If there were a direct competitor the one that comes to mind is Basil Haydenâs - a premium easy-sipping bourbon with mass appeal. When comparing taste, Old Elk blows it out of the water. Itâs far more satisfying, and my hunch is more carefully crafted. As someone who scrutinizes bourbons on a regular basis, I actually found myself enjoying this, and will recommend it without hesitation every time someone asks me for a âsmoothâ sipping bourbon.",,Old Elk Blended Straight Bourbon
152, Straight Bourbon,Luxco,Undisclosed,117,7 Years, $40 (2018),"A very traditional set of bourbon scents consisting of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and oak. Its mild for a high proof bourbon and its aromas are straightforward with no frills. Its basic and unexciting, yet solid nevertheless. It has a touch of cherry and spice near the end, but itâs fleeting and not at all impactful.","A surprisingly lively burst of flavor that ranges from sweet fruit, to rich caramel and spicy oak. Its heat can get in the way of the flavors at times, but doesnât muddle or suppress them to a detrimental degree. This is a full-flavored affair, with adequate complexity and a very satisfying impact.","Oak, spice, and dark cherries ride the finish out to its natural conclusion. The heat is long lasting and doesnât make it easy to forget. Itâs a bit too dry and more thin than I would have liked, but thankfully there is a nice pop of vanilla and candied apple near the end that is short, but beneficial.","This release is much like what Luxco did two years ago when they breathed new life in the Rebel Yell brand - they released a new variant of a brand few ever took notice of, and it helped turn much needed attention towards it. Of course it also helped that Rebel Yell Single Barrel was quite good. The company is using that same strategy and hoping to create a similar success story for Ezra Brooks.Ezra Brooks 7 Year 101 Proof is an often neglected and overlooked bourbon you may have seen on the shelf at one point or another, but probably rarely buy. The brand has been around for a long time and years ago when age statements were plentiful, it struggled for attention. Years later as the majority of mid-tier bourbon age statements disappeared, the bourbon is starting to get the attention it (rightfully?) deserves. Ezra Brooks 7 Year 101 Proof was never going to light the world on fire with its flavor profile, but still to this day, it offers what many other bourbons donât: decent quality at a great price, and most notably, an age statement.Luxco took what they did with Rebel Yell, what they were already doing well with Ezra Brooks 7 Year 101 Proof, upped the proof, and voila, they have a new product people can get behind. The flavor profile isnât going to shock anyone with its uniqueness, but it is interesting how upping the proof changes this bourbon. It does what barrel proof bourbons are supposed to do but can sometimes struggle with. This isnât just a hotter version of the standard offering, but a richer, fuller flavored, and all around great tasting bourbon.","Bourbon drinkers have become accustomed to barrel proof bourbons commanding a certain price. For years Bookerâs maintained the industry line of $55, but like age statements, those days are long gone. 1792 has made a name for itself over the past four years releasing a number of new expressions well below market pricing, and that includes their Full Proof bourbon at $45. While some companies may try to hit this customer friendly pricing, few in reality actually do. Thatâs why it's even more surprising Old Ezra came in at $40 and maintained the brandâs mantra of quality bourbon at a great value. This release could have been marked up $10 higher and still would have easily been worth the price. Most importantly, this pricing keeps drinker expectations in check and in Old Ezra Barrel Strengthâs case, perhaps it wasnât even needed.",October 2018,Old Ezra 7 Year Barrel Strength
153, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,100,9 Years, $90 (2018),"Soft classic scents of vanilla, hay, and light oak blend together. On the surface it doesnât seem overly complex, but digging deeper thereâs raisin, light green apple, and a smidge of cinnamon and brown sugar mixed together. The scents mingle extremely well together and present a solid start to this bourbon.","The sip provides a nice creamy viscous mouthfeel. Delicious syrupy sweet vanilla, raisins, a dab of lavender infused honey, and a touch of butterscotch. Even though itâs a 100 proof bourbon, thereâs almost no burn which allows you to savor this for a while. Itâs gentle yet full of flavor and simply put, fantastic.","A warming heat that showcases light oak, sweet vanilla, and a slight hint of golden raisins. The raisins are very fleeting, and leave behind a light sweet vanilla and oak taste that lingers for a short bit. This eventually transitions to just a light oak that gently lingers for a while. Itâs a really nice way to cap the sip, however after the fantastic palate, I canât help but want more out of the finish.","Bottled-in-Bond bourbons are actually more common than you think. Buffalo Trace has their E.H. Taylor line, Brown-Forman has Old Forester 1897, and Heaven Hill has a slew of Bottled-in-Bond bourbons and whiskeys. However just because a whiskey is labeled Bottled-in-Bond doesnât guarantee that it will be good. All you know for sure is that the whiskey is at least 4 years old, bottled at 100 proof, and is the product of one distillation season and one distiller at a single distillery.The Fall 2018 Edition of Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond delivers a wonderful overall sip. Itâs rich creamy mouthfeel and well defined flavors all eb and flow incredibly well and deliver an experience that many other Bottled-in-Bonds in the market currently donât. Itâs more impressive that it does all of this without being a high proof bomb or carrying a double digit age statement, which seems to be a rarity nowadays when compared to other highly regarded limited releases.","The first edition was an 11 year old bourbon that was priced with a suggested MSRP of $110. Seeing as the fall 2018 edition is 9 years old and is priced at $90, Heaven Hillâs pricing strategy seems to be about $10 a year for their limited edition Bottled-in-Bond releases. Even the24 year old Parkerâs Heritage Bottled-in-Bond was priced at $250.While this pricing strategy is easy for consumers to understand, it still represents a big upcharge compared to other Bottled-in-Bond bourbons in the market. Heaven Hill alone makes two well received Bottled-in-Bond bourbons that are both under $30, that being Henry McKenna 10 Year and the Heaven Hill Bottled-in-Bond.That said, price alone doesnât solely determine value. In this case, the bourbon is fantastic and delivers an experience that makes you feel justified with the money you spent on this release. As a bonus, the bourbon comes in a bottle that can serve as a great home bar decanter once itâs emptied out. With a sub $100 price tag and a flavor profile that can back up the high cost, Heaven Hill priced this one right on the money.",August 2018,Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond 9 Year  Fall 2018 Release
154, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,100,NAS, $15 (2017),"An enjoyable swirl of honey, vanilla, and oak notes. Easy on the nose thanks to additional hints of candy corn and sugar cookies. Overall on the lighter side with a shallow depth of scents. Absent of any harshness.","The bourbonâs slight buttery mouthfeel acts as a enjoyable welcoming agent. Itâs immediately evident that oak is the most dominant flavor. It overshadows lighter notes of vanilla and caramel that the bourbon desperately needs more of. Surprisingly, the oak doesnât come across as overbearing despite this, just one-dimensional. This is due to the overall thinness of the bourbon and its lightweight palate. Much like the nose, there are no bad elements here, only a few OK ones.","What can best be described as a âdry heatâ envelopes your mouth in the finish. The oak notes and notable burn combine to leave a rather flat and dry aftertaste. Thankfully this combination doesnât produce a bitter aftertaste. Instead, the burn slowly mellows as it goes down. Once again the oak is the attention grabber on the finish.","At one time, having wheat as a bourbonâs secondary grain instead of rye made a whiskey unique. Old Fitzgerald was the go-to wheated bourbon for many whiskey drinkers. Makerâs Mark might have been more well-known and mainstream in the later part of the 20th Century, but it was the âOld Fitzâ brand where many went for inexpensive, higher aged, higher proof wheated bourbon.Thanks to the rise in popularity of Pappy Van Winkle there are more than a dozen wheated whiskeys in the marketplace. What was once a unique selling point for the brand, is now more common. Old Fitzgerald BiB has maintained steady availability around Kentucky over the years, but has disappeared from many other parts of the country. Some believe its phasing out is the result of the Heaven Hill rebranding it as âLarcenyâ as they share the same mashbill. With Larceny arguably a better product and readily available in most parts of the country, there's little need in seeking out Old Fitzgerald anymore.","Coming in at half the cost of many comparable wheated bourbons, Old Fitzgeraldâs bargain price does a lot to make up for its shortcomings. This is another budget BiB bourbon on the market that is made for a everyday drinking. Itâs inexpensive and easy to drink. It shares many common traits with other sub-$20 whiskeys; itâs thin, lacks flavor depth, is heavily oaked, yet still very drinkable.Comparing it to Larceny and Makerâs Mark, Old Fitzgerald is notably hotter and its palate a bit more meager. The brands do share many similarities, most damningly their lack of depth, but Larceny and Makerâs Markâs fuller tasting and rounder palates are ultimately more enjoyable. Old Fitzgerald is priced exactly what it should be. Any more would be asking too much.",Ongoing,Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond Bourbon
155, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,100,13 Years, $130 (2019),"The nose opens with a warm mix of scents. Baked sweet bread, allspice, cinnamon bark, light custard, and a touch of seasoned oak come together in a harmonious way. Itâs an enticing way to start and really invites you to explore the sip more.","A touch of heat and nice amount of sweetness form the base of this bourbon. Summer fruits, yellow cake, vanilla, and honey mingle with a base layer of light spice. The flavors come across as more impactful and the bourbon drinks a little hotter than you would expect from a 100 proof bourbon. The end result is a very satisfying sip thatâs hard to dislike.","The extra time this bourbon spent in the barrel shows in the finish. Oak, white pepper, and sweet summer fruits are quite noticeable up front. These transition to vanilla, a lingering heat, and eventually just oak. Medium in length, while the finish is still good, comparatively itâs the weakest part of the overall sip. ","As I mentioned in my Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond 9 Year Fall 2018 review, Bottled-in-Bond bourbons, while not a dime a dozen, are quite plentiful nowadays. From an age perspective, the spring 2019 release isnât the oldest to date either. That honor goes to the 14 year distillery only release that came out in the fall of 2018.From a flavor perspective however, the spring 2019 release is a really great wheated bourbon. While it doesnât quite match the level that the fall 2018 release delivered, it comes very close. For the most part its flavors are well balanced and defined, and its sip stands out from the other Bottled-in-Bond bourbons on the market.","The nice aspect about this Old Fitzgerald series, is that Heaven Hill seems to be pricing by the year in $10 increments. While that isnât the norm with most limited release bottles, it seems to work well here. In this case, $130 for a 13 year Bottled-in-Bond seems like a fair value, especially one with such an impressive flavor profile. Sure you could say that about Weller 12 Year, but even if you were able to find a bottle at MSRP, Weller 12 Year comes in at 10 proof points lower and doesnât carry the Bottled-in-Bond designation either. Add in the fact that 13 year old wheated bourbons arenât at all common and its throwback decanter style bottle is a great talking piece, and you get a great overall value.",,Old Fitzgerald Bottled-in-Bond 13 Year Spring 2019 Release
156, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,90,NAS (4-4.5 years under heat cycle), $45 (2015),"Very bright and lively with its fruity and floral notes at the forefront. Underneath, vanilla and caramel provide the base and a delightful amount of oak is mixed in.",This a bourbon that actually tastes like it smells. Itâs a delightful mingling of vibrant fruit flavors. The sweetness from the caramel and an agreeable amount of oak makes this an easy to enjoy bourbon.,"Despite a light body and thin mouthfeel, it has a really nice finish. As the sweetness trails off it finishes with cinnamon, nutmeg and a mix of other baking spices. A light amount of oak can also be tasted throughout the finish and helps provide a lasting aftertaste.","In the 1800âs bourbon was sold by the barrel which caused quality and taste to vary from release to release. Old Foresterâs founder George Garvin Brown changed the industry by âbatchingâ his bourbon. This meant that he took bourbons from three different distilleries and âbatchedâ them together to create a consistent product. To commemorate this process and tradition, Brown-Forman is blending barrels from three different warehouses and three different days of production, each with varying entering proof to create 1870 Original Batch.On paper, Iâm not exactly sure why I should be excited about this release. Although Old Foresterâs history makes a good story, this process nowadays is common practice. They state on their website that this âechoesâ Brownâs original 1870 batching process, but I feel âechoesâ might be too strong of a word in this case. There is no mention of mashbills and itâs unclear how this differs from their standard Old Forester brand. Blending from different warehouses at different proofs doesnât scream unique. Does 1870 taste different than the standard Old Forester and Birthday Bourbon brands? While the brands share some basic flavor similarities, there are some major differences as well. If you blind taste tested them, Iâm pretty confident most bourbon drinkers could accurately call them out. So the question is: Is 1870 worth the money?","Simply put, $45 for a batched bourbon seems on the high side. Old Forester released their limited edition Birthday Bourbon this year for $55 and I get the feeling that itâs a more carefully curated release than 1870 yet both are similar in price. Brown-Forman has given no indication that theyâre picking honey barrels for this release, so Iâm not entirely sure why this is priced at $45. Generally, higher priced bourbons (above $40) have a more informative story behind them that warrants the price. Most likely, Brown-Forman is simply filling a gap in their pricing structure with this new Whiskey Row brand. Ultimately, it always comes back to whatâs in the bottle. This is easily an above average bourbon, so Iâll give it a pass on its slightly high asking price.",February 2015,Old Forester 1870 Original Batch Bourbon
157, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,100,NAS, $50 (2015),A bright and lively blast of fruit with complementing floral and oak elements. The light sting from the alcohol is warming with a slight burn. Really nice and inviting overall.,"A great mix of sweet and spicy. Dark fruit is most prominent, with hints of caramel, vanilla, and just the right amount of oak rounding it out. The sweetness here is balanced by a nearly perfect spice note. It coats the mouth nicely making for a great mouthfeel. Overall well-rounded and quite balanced.","Long, sweet, and almost perfectly balanced. The flavors in the palate linger for minutes after the sip with a tapering sweetness and light spiciness leaving a great aftertaste. One of the better finishes Iâve experienced in a while.","The Bottled-in-Bond designation doesnât seem to have the significance today that it once did. The historical references make it pretty clear the Act was necessary to help consumers avoid adulterated whiskey, which could have conceivably had just about anything added to it for flavoring or coloring purposes. Today, I associate Bottled-in-Bond with low cost, surprisingly good whiskeys such as Old Grand Dad Bourbon and Rittenhouse Rye - of which are probably overlooked too often in favor of more popular labels and better bottle designs. The exception to this is E.H. Taylor, which is marketed as a premium line of Bottled-in-Bond whiskeys with additional distinguishing characteristics - small batch, single barrel, barrel proof, rye, etc. Iâd argue those additional characteristics seem to take the spotlight, often making us forget that the Taylor line is, in fact, Bottled-in-Bond. The point is, the concept of introducing a premium Bottled-in-Bond whiskey is not new, but itâs also not popular and not well associated with premium brands. Brown-Forman appears to be employing a marketing strategy here, playing into both the year of the Act with its name as well as tribute to their own historical Bottled-in-Bond offering when the act was passed. Iâm cool with that. Where whiskey marketing with historical reference is often a reach at best, this actually has some real meaning and a seal of quality to go with it.As for taste, the most prominent characteristic for me is the fruit-forward character which is somewhat similar to Old Foresterâs first Whiskey Row release, 1870 Original Batch. The 1897 Bottled In Bond certainly provides deeper flavor intensity due to the higher proof and richer mouthfeel, and although not exactly the same, the underlying characteristics are similar. Regardless, none of this makes for a knock-your-socks-off unique flavor profile, but it does offer enough to set the taste slightly apart from anything else I can think of.","This is priced at a premium, but todayâs marketplace commands it. Itâs one thing to suddenly raise the price of something already on the shelf, say Elijah Craig 12 year from $25 to $50 (prediction: this will happen, just not suddenly). However, when introducing a new premium offering itâs not unexpected to see it priced that way right out of the gate. With that in mind, this pricing is also in the area of some excellent options - Four Roses Single Barrel 100 Proof ($35-$45), Four Roses Private Selections Barrel Proof ($55-$65), Knob Creek Single Barrel($40-$45), Blantonâs Single Barrel ($50-$60), and Russellâs Reserve Single Barrel ($50-$55), to name a few. I havenât spent enough time with this bourbon to really let it sink in as I have with the others listed, but based on my experience so far the quality is there to merit the price point. I think this will sell well and I could see some enthusiasts finding the flavor profile ideal to include as one of their daily sippers.",September 2015,Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond Bourbon
158, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,93,NAS, $55 (2018),"Oaky and lightly sweet. Rich caramel leads the way with an undertone of vanilla, fresh baked cake, frosting, and a dab of sweet pecans. A light layer of rich oak rounds it out. Itâs subtle yet easy to appreciate and foreshadows the rest of the sip. I found the nose continued to become more and more enjoyable as I let the pour sit in the glass. This is one bourbon that youâll want to take your time with when drinking.","Old Forester 1910 delivers a nice, thick and chewy mouthfeel. The sugars from the char are really evident. The palate is sickly sweet with a heavy layer of burnt caramel and vanilla. Hidden deep beneath are dark berries along with toasted marshmallows. All of these flavors rest upon a layer of oak. Itâs amazing how viscous the mouthfeel is. Itâs not incredibly deep in terms of flavor range, however itâs extremely enjoyable.","While oak played a role in the nose and palate, oak is front and center in the finish. A dominating flavor of charred oak leads the charge and is intermingled with a light dose of caramel and vanilla. These sweeter flavors fade and are replaced with dry leather and light cigar box. These flavors linger for an unusually long time. Itâs a satisfying finish and one that makes you realize how well this bourbon might pair with a cigar.","The Whiskey Row series has been a great experiment in showing just how different Old Forester can taste when varying the proof and aging conditions. Old Forester 1910 is no exception to this, and delivers another unique tasting experience thatâs completely different from the rest of the series. The first question most will ask themselves, is how does this hold up to the fantastic Old Forester 1920? I have to admit, that this question lingered in my mind as I started this review until I realized that this isnât the comparison that Old Forester 1910 deserves.Unlike in 1910 when Old Forester first pioneered the concept of double barreling bourbon, this technique is now more widely used today. In fact, Brown-Forman embraced this same technique when they launched Woodford Reserve Double Oaked. When comparing the two, itâs interesting to see just how much more of an impact the double barreling had on Old Forester 1910 versus Woodford Double Oaked. I find Double Oaked to be a very enjoyable product, but Old Forester 1910 seems to deliver an enhanced sip in most areas. The charred barrel impact is very evident in both the sweetness delivered in the palate and the consistent oak flavoring throughout the sip. Surprisingly, the oak isnât overdone, which results in a rich overall sip and lingering oaky finish.","This is the second highest priced bottle in the Whiskey Row series. However donât let that fool you. This entire series is separated by only $15 from the cheapest to the most expensive. Kudos should be given to Brown-Forman for making the entire series affordable for most.In comparison to the aforementioned Woodford Double Oaked, the $10 price premium feels justified for the elevated product youâre getting. Anything above MSRP would be pricing this too high, but at this price, youâre able to still enjoy a rich, albeit oaky, bourbon for under $60. While itâs tempting to pay $5 more for Old Forester 1920, youâd also be buying a totally different tasting product and missing out on the experience Old Forester 1910 delivers in its own right.",October 2018,Old Forester 1910 Old Fine Whisky
159, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,115,NAS, $60 (2017),"The aroma is rich and powerful. Dark fruit, burnt brown sugar, chocolate, and a hint of bananas make up the components. Not surprising for the proof, it tingles the nostrils with a trace of ethanol. Itâs a nice aroma overall, and can be easily described as a unique relative to other bourbons.","Itâs big, bold, and immediately likeable. The richness of barrel char and dark chocolate play against the sweetness of caramel and creme brulee. Thereâs a nuttiness to it as well, along with some smokiness and a hint of coffee. The taste is reminiscent of some of the better Old Forester Birthday Bourbons Iâve had, but admittedly more pronounced and, to put it bluntly, better than I remember.","Allspice and black pepper pop initially. They quickly dissipate and leave a long-lingering finish without further introduction of new flavors, but a pleasing end to those introduced on the palate. Dark chocolate, barrel char, and that nuttiness are the most prominent. Itâs a nice finish, plain and simple.","One of the first things that comes to mind with this bourbon is a likeness to a stout beer, no different than what I noticed in Old Foresterâs 2013 Birthday Bourbon. Thatâs not to say it tastes like a beer, but where porters and stouts are often rich, chocolatey, dark beers, 1920 is a rich, chocolatey, dark bourbon. This characteristic is evident immediately. Not surprisingly, I prefer darker beers and also really enjoy this bourbon. Itâs one of the few bourbons Iâve ever had that I took an instant liking to on my first sip.While it presumably shares the same mashbill as the others in the Whiskey Row Series, itâs amazing how different it tastes. Sure the proof is higher, but inside we find an entirely different flavor profile. Brown-Forman provides little to go by as far as what might have contributed to this, other than barrel selection and masterful blending. Even by comparison with the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon Series, which can be enjoyable and echo similar flavor characteristics most likely due to the particular rickhouse and floor the barrels are pulled from, 1920 seems to stand out by offering better balance and an immediately enjoyable experience. I didnât have to peel back layers to enjoy it.","The Whiskey Row Series is a premium line extension, and priced as such. Following suit with brands like Buffalo Traceâs E.H. Taylor lineup, itâs not surprising to see this type of premium line extension becoming more prominent. On one hand, we can say 1920 Prohibition Style is just the standard brand, same mashbill, just presented in upscale packaging and flavor profile. However, itâs important to acknowledge that whiskey makers control what they put in the bottle. In this increasingly competitive space, better distillation practices along with more careful barrel selection, blending, proofing, and other factors can lead to better final products in the end. Itâs ultimately up to the consumers to decide whether itâs just a marketing play, or truly something more.In this case, Iâm fully behind the price tag, and excited for what Brown-Forman has done here. Like the others in the Whiskey Row Series, 1920 Prohibition Style introduces a complete new experience to the lineup, and itâs a good one. Itâs more than just marketing, and whatever they did to curate this bourbon I can get behind. At $60, or even a little more in some markets, itâs just as good as many bourbons going for well in excess of $100. More importantly, itâs actually accessible.",Ongoing,Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style Bourbon
160, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,97,12 Years, $40 (2009),"This bourbon has a very refined smell to it. For a 97 proof bourbon, I was surprised at how upfront the alcohol was in the nose. Immediately past the alcohol smell is a delicious mixture of aged wood, caramel, raisins, and a hint of vanilla. The scent took me right to an aging warehouse in the KY countryside on a cool autumn day with all of the barrels aging. It could be the name influencing me here, but the combinations of smells gives off a sense of a delicious day old baked holiday cake. Really just a great nose on this bourbon.",You can tell that this bourbon has spent some time in the wood. The palate is best described as a slightly sweet earthy flavor. It starts with a mixture of light honey and leather and lingers on an oaky charred wood flavor. The combination plays nicely in your mouth together.,"The finish on this bourbon was very long, dry, and mild. Hints of butterscotch initially appeared up front, however, the finish was predominantly spicy, akin to a mild ground black pepper. While not bad, it didnât blow me away like the nose did and was a distinct step down from the palate leading into it.","Donât be fooled by thinking that this bourbon is just a marketing stunt due to the unique bottle shape chosen by Brown-Forman for this birthday series. Each yearly release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon is completely unique when comparing it to the years before and after. Since the Birthday series usually uses the normal Old Forester Mashbill of 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted, you get to see how aging has varied over time based on years spent in the barrel, location of the barrels, aging conditions, etc.You also get to try Old Forester at a higher age and unique proof than what is normally offered. Higher in proof than Old Forester Classic (86 proof), slightly lower than Old Forester Signature (100 proof), and aged longer than both, it proves to be a nice variation for fans of Old Forester.  Less than 100 barrels are bottled on a yearly basis, which makes this one of the more consistent quality limited edition offerings on the market.","Iâve always found the Old Forester Birthday series to be a great value and the 2009 version was no exception to this. At $40, this was a great value back in â09 when it was purchased. While itâs near impossible to find today and the price will be much higher on the secondary market, itâs being judged on the price that was paid at retail. Compared to say the yearly release of Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch which usually retails for $100, this bourbon is a great deal at less than half the cost. You get a one-off unique bourbon that is full of flavor and can hold its own against newer releases on the market.",September 2009,Old Forester 2009 Birthday Bourbon
161, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,98,12 Years, $50 (2011),"The Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series usually delivers when it comes to their nose and the 2011 edition is no exception. On first whiff, I was hit with fresh oak and light vanilla. Taking a longer inhale brought about scents of fresh picked berries, milk chocolate, and new leather. It smelled so good that I had to consciously force myself to stop enjoying the nose to take a sip!","The sugars from the wood are very present in the palate. The first taste that touched my tongue was fresh sugar cane. The flavors of apricots, raisins, mixed dried fruit, honey and new wood mingled together. On the whole, the palate was light and airy, tasting a lot younger than the 12 years this bourbon sat in wood.","The finish on this bourbon was really neat. While most bourbons present a long warm finish that slowly makes its way from your mouth down to your throat, this finish tended to stay upfront and present in my mouth. It instantly warmed my mouth and stayed there for a good 2-3 minutes. It presented notes of toasted oak, honey, and a touch of cinnamon.","Donât be fooled into thinking that this bourbon is just a marketing stunt because of its unique shaped bottle. Each yearly release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon is completely unique. Since the Birthday series usually uses the normal Old Forester Mashbill of 72% corn, 18% rye, and 10% malted, you get to see how aging has varied over time based on years spent in the barrel, location of the barrels, aging conditions, etc.The 2011 edition of this bourbon was really special. It was only a 66 barrel dump, which reverses the trend of going for the larger barrel dumps that the â09 and â10 versions saw, and is just 4 barrels more than the 62 barrel 2008 batch. Old Forester picked some great barrels for this batch, as this bourbon tastes much younger than the 12 year age statement would lead you to believe.  Because of this, it really carries through rich fruity flavors.","Iâve always found the Old Forester Birthday series to be a great value and the 2011 version was no exception. At $50, this was a great value back in â11 when it was purchased. While itâs near impossible to find today and the price will be much higher on the secondary market, itâs being judged on the price that was paid at retail.For the money, it's a really great bourbon that could have easily been sold for $25-30 more and still be considered a fair value. Iâm glad that I have a spare on hand, and this bottle has convinced me to stock up on the new release of the Birthday Bourbon every fall!",September 2011,Old Forester 2011 Birthday Bourbon
162, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,97,12 Years, $55 (2012),"Very sweet and nice smelling. The vanilla, caramel and brown sugar are very, very prevalent. It has a perfect amount of oak to go with it which balances the sweetness out. A small amount of alcohol is present.","Spot on with the nose, with the addition of cinnamon and baking spices. Hints of rye spices also seem to show themselves. Very pleasant and agreeable.",Thereâs a little bit of dryness that creeps in with the finish. Being a 12 year old bourbon this makes sense. The dryness also brings with it some spice and heat on the backside of the finish. Great end to the whole experience.,"The flavors in the 2012 edition are nothing you canât find in many other bourbons. Vanilla, caramel and brown sugar are found in almost every bourbon. What makes this yearâs edition special is the intensity of those flavors and the fantastic balance of them. When you then mix in the right amount of oak, spice and dryness, the 2012 edition really becomes the full package. Also, the extra 2% of malt added to the standard Old Forester mashbill in this Birthday edition had a positive impact on the flavor over previous years, but again, I wouldnât necessarily call those flavors unique.","Thereâs a lot of state by state price fluctuation on the Forester Birthday bourbons. They can range anywhere from $40-60. With that being said, the year-to-year uniqueness this line exhibits and the general high level of quality makes this a fantastic value for the MSRP of $55. There arenât a lot of bourbons on the market in that price range, let alone many limited edition bottles. I always feel I get my moneyâs worth with the Old Forester Birthday Bourbons.",September 2012,Old Forester 2012 Birthday Bourbon

A little alcohol pulls through as well resulting in some warming tingling of the nostrils.","The flavors are led by heat up front, more than would be expected for the proof and as compared to preceding releases. A wide range of complex flavors are hiding behind the heat but it takes a little concentration to sort through them. Barrel char, dark chocolate, rye spice, cinnamon stick, cigar box, caramel, and vanilla follow the heat. Burnt brown sugar and citrus round things out. All of this is capped with some more heat as you swallow, so if you drink it too fast you might just miss the complexity of flavors with this one finding heat at the front and backend of the sip. Bold and complex overall.","The heat lingers for a few seconds then immediately tapers off. Hints of the flavors on the palate linger, with barrel char and burnt brown sugar being the most prominent for me. Medium to long lasting.","This edition is the most bold and complex of the limited release Birthday Bourbons Iâve sampled. This also happened to be the first year Brown-Forman stopped giving detail on the bottle, so we may naturally assume it shares a similar mash bill with previous releases. However, the flavor profile is so different this may not be the case, leaving us something to ponder. In fact, I related the flavor profile more closely to Elijah Craig 12 Year and Elijah Craig Barrel Proof more than anything else I could think of - the bold, dark sugars, and barrel char elements specifically.","Even though Brown-Forman is no longer telling us the specifics about the release as of this year, $55 for a bold, complex, 12 year-old limited release is still a bargain.",September 2013,Old Forester 2013 Birthday Bourbon
164, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,97,12 Years, $60 (2014),"The nose on the 2014 edition is really fantastic and I found it to be very well balanced. Upon first whiff, youâll notice that this bourbon leans heavily towards the sweet side. Caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, maple, and weirdly enough fresh straw scents are all present up front. Itâs really a fantastic nose that makes you want to linger on it for a while before tasting the bourbon.","The palate is sweet, but not quite as sweet as the nose may lead you to believe. I found the bourbon to have a rich and creamy mouthfeel with predominant notes of burnt sugar, vanilla, allspice, and a hint of butterscotch. While I didnât think the palate was quite as good as past editions (2011 and 2012 for example), I still found it very enjoyable and better than many of the recent limited edition releases Iâve tasted this year.","The finish started off dryer and hotter than I expected, especially when you take into account that itâs only a 97 proof bourbon. The heat lingers for a few moments before it fading away to flavors of old wood, vanilla frosting, and a long lasting taste of lightly toasted sugar. Itâs not a bad finish per se, but it's definitely the weakest part of the flavor profile on this bourbon.","While no specific details are given on this 2014 edition, once again Brown-Forman delivers a unique bourbon. This edition of the Birthday Bourbon Series reminded me more of the 2011 and 2012 editions versus the 2013 edition. While no aging notes are provided again this year, I would be inclined to say that this was pulled from a different section of the warehouse than where the 2013 edition was aged. This bourbon contained all the sweetness upfront that has defined the Birthday Series, and it delivers an above average and hotter than normal finish.","At $60 this is the most expensive edition of the Birthday Bourbon Series to date. But, it's worth the money. Its great nose and strong flavor profile back up the asking price. And, compared to other brands, this bourbon is still one of the least expensive limited edition releases this year.While Brown-Forman has been increasing the price by $5 for the past few years, hopefully they cap the price at the $60 mark for another year or two before the next increase. This is a great series, but it would be a shame for them to continue to increase the price without increasing the quality or, at the least, providing the aging notes once again.",September 2014,Old Forester 2014 Birthday Bourbon

Dried tobacco leaves, mahogany, toasted oak, dried dark raisins and an underlying hint of chocolate are all noticeable. To me, this nose makes me think of fall. Rich in character and begging to be sipped outside on a deck while taking in the fall foliage.","What jumps out at me immediately with this yearâs version is how much drier it is than in years past. While a very light honey sweetness is noticeable, predominate flavors are dried wood, mixed-nuts, and subtle hints of dried orange all swirl together. Compared to the 2014 edition, the extra 3 proof points doesnât add any additional heat to the palate. While the palate is tasty and the notes of sweet honey were more noticeable the longer I let it open up, compared to the palate on recent past years versions, I feel this years palate doesnât stand up to them as much.","Immediately noticeable is a peppery spice on the finish that seems to be isolated to my tongue only. This is followed by charred oak, leather, tobacco, and drier types of nuts such as a walnut for example. The nuttiness and heat linger and slowly dissipate over the next two minutes. It should be noted that the heat was isolated to my tongue only and never once moved down to my throat or stomach. This nutty finish is reminiscent of the 2009 edition with just a tad more spice upfront and a slightly fuller flavor profile.","The 2015 edition is an interesting bourbon to ponder. From a Birthday Bourbon series standpoint, itâs the highest proof release to date, along with the only edition where the barrels all come from a single warehouse. However, with the proof increase comes the fact that this yearâs Birthday Bourbon is the same proof as Old Forester Signature. It needs to be noted though that the flavor profiles are totally different and the extra years in the barrel set this far apart from Old Forester Signature.In terms of direct comparisons, this edition reminds me more of the 2009 edition more than any other recent past edition. Its woody, nutty flavor is a deviation of the sweetness usually found and the extra little spice on the finish was a nice addition. This series still tends to be the most consistently best tasting bourbon that Brown Forman produces each year in my book, and they should be given credit for this. It takes a lot to pull barrels from various warehouses (or a single warehouse in this year's case), with slightly different mashbills year after year and still release a really great product. Kudos to them on that point!","The past few years has seen the Birthday Bourbon series go up a few dollars every year, and the 2015 edition is no exception. It actually bests all previous increases by being priced about $20 higher than the $60 asking price of the 2014 edition. While in the past it was easy to justify the price due to the great nose the series has along with a flavor profile to back it up, but $80 is pushing the limit. At $80 Old Forester Birthday Bourbon is now priced the same or higher then a number of other limited released bourbons such as Michterâs Toasted Barrel Finish, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, and the entire Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, not to mention everyday favorites such as Blantonâs Single Barrel and Four Roses Single Barrel.Brown Forman realizes that there is a bourbon boom going on and that they can capitalize on it. And capitalize it they did. This year they specifically called out that there would only be 13,200 bottles for sale and even handed out t-shirts stating âI Went To Buy Old Forester Birthday Bourbon. And All I Got Was This Free T-Shirtâ If thatâs not feeding the whole bourbon hype, I donât know what is.Is this a good bourbon? Yes it is. In fact itâs the best thing that Brown Forman releases. That being said, when you ask if this is this a good bourbon for $80, the answer becomes more of a mixed bag. Sure youâre getting one of the more consistent limited edition releases for the money, however at the same time you're paying $80 for only a 12 year old 100 proof bourbon. When you get into this price range I expect more out of the bourbon itself... not just a good bourbon that is limited production.",September 2015,Old Forester 2015 Birthday Bourbon
166, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,97,12 Years, $80 (2016),"The Birthday Bourbon series has always delivered a delicious nose that you want to linger on, and this yearâs edition lives up to the standard set by past editions. A delightfully rich nose reveals upfront scents of honey, vanilla, fresh cut flowers, and a delicious dose of bubble gum. Further nosing reveals delicate notes of aged oak, leather, and a hint of dried golden raisins.","Creamy notes of rich breakfast buns mix with bold citrus flavors and rich oak. All of these flavors mingle together to form a palate on the sweeter side that is delicate, yet full of flavor. This has a lighter mouthfeel that forces you to hunt a little harder for the full picture, but itâs worth the reward. Itâs not the deepest palate, but can hold its own in the series, and reminds me a lot of the sweet creamy palate of the 2014 release. Itâs a nice improvement over the dry palate found in last yearâs bottling.","The finish has all the right ingredients; a dab of tempered heat up front, a nice amount of oak interweaves with a rich syrupy flavoring sprinkled with brown sugar, and a lingering subtle oak taste that lingers for a while. This sounds like it should be a grand slam, but after a complex and rich experience up to this point, the finish seems to fizzle out, versus trying to go out on a high note. This unfortunately seems to be a trend in recent years with the finish being the weakest part of each sip.","Iâm happy to see that Brown-Forman brought back more detailed aging notes this year. Marketing mumbo jumbo on âwestward facing windowsâ and âsun kissedâ whatnot aside, this earns a unique placement in the series. This is partly due to the fact that itâs the largest release ever, but also for once again delivering a tasty flavor profile that makes you look forward to the next sip. In a year of some mundane releases, the unique nose and palate were refreshing to experience.The Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series is one that consistently delivers a unique experience that has yet to disappoint me in a given year. While each release is different, such as the drier flavor profile of the 2015 edition or the bold and complex flavor profile of the 2013 edition, they all deliver an experience that never lets me down. A lot of people love consistency in a limited release, and thatâs okay. However for this series, the ability to consistently deliver a unique experience is whatâs so great in my opinion. It makes me look forward to and wonder what the next year will bring.Iâve mentioned this every time Iâve reviewed this series before but Iâll say it again, my biggest gripe for this series is the bottle design. I realize that Brown-Forman is trying to play up the fact that it's a celebration bottle and brought it to retail in an ""old fashioned"" style bottle. However, it takes up a lot of shelf space and is a true pain to pour from. Iâm sure the design wonât change anytime soon and Iâm sure I wonât stop complaining about the design on future editions.","The value conundrum with this bourbon goes far back and returns again this year. Before the bourbon boom hit, this series was reasonably priced at $40 up until 2009. Brown-Forman has capitalized on the bourbon boom and has slowly been raising the price, capping off at $80 for the 2015 edition. While $80 seems like a lot of money for this series considering its past price points, itâs the new norm.Amazingly enough, even in this booming market, the price for this yearâs edition hasnât gone up and has actually held steady. As the Old Forester Whiskey Row series continues to rise in price with each new release, itâs nice to see the price of the Birthday Bourbon stay the same. Seeing as other limited releases this year, such as the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, Four Roses 2016 Limited Edition Small Batch, and the Knob Creek 2001 Limited Editions all cost $10-$50 more, this bourbon now seems like a great value. You may not be happy with an $80 price tag, but compared to other releases this year, Brown-Forman is presenting consumers with a more than fair deal.",September 2016,Old Forester 2016 Birthday Bourbon
167, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,96 (also released in a 95.4 proof expression),12 Years, $80 (2017),"Burnt caramel, sweet vanilla, and a hint of spice come forward against a backdrop of seasoned oak. I also sense a bit of charred oak, layering in some depth on the nose. Itâs a notably delightful aroma, creating a welcoming introduction that entices deeper exploration.","Charred oak and a healthy dose of spice hit first. Theyâre followed by chocolate, as the bourbon coats the insides of my mouth. As it lingers, thereâs a trace of dark fruit, but itâs hidden well behind the initial flavors. Itâs very good overall, and at 96 proof the intensity of the flavors is just about right, though thereâs a part of me that wants a bit more.","Itâs here that I notice how mouth-coating this bourbon is, as the texture lingers intensely after I swallow. It ends with a nice long finish as chocolate, spice, and charred oak taper off. Considering the 96 proof left me wanting a little more on the palate, the finish almost makes up for it with its long lasting presence and lingering mouthfeel.","Weâve reviewed a number of Birthday Bourbons and for me they seem to share deep, rich, chocolate and barrel char flavor characteristics. Typically at 12 years old, this series has enough time to have developed a complex flavor profile, but not necessarily so long that it enters the territory of being over-oaked. This yearâs vintage maintains the characteristics that Iâm familiar with, and manages to round out some of the rough edges that Iâve noticed in past releases.Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style was released last year around the same time as 2016 Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, and has been out long enough to have reached most bourbon enthusiasts. Met with critical acclaim in many cases, the burning question on my mind was how this premium release within the same brand compared with this yearâs Birthday Bourbon. To put it bluntly, I like 1920 a bit better. But I think 1920 really pulls ahead as a result of its nearly 20 additional proof points, not necessarily because its flavor profile is just that much better. Considering Birthday Bourbonâs characteristically rich, chocolatey, barrel char flavor profile, which is really good at 96 proof, it seems like it would be fantastic at a higher proof. Knowing just how good 1920 is at its 115 proof, Iâd really like to see a limited run of specially selected barrels with Birthday Bourbonâs flavor characteristics released at barrel proof.","This yearâs edition comes in at the same price as last yearâs, $80. Itâs a good price for an established limited release from a major distillery in todayâs market, and as a result nearly impossible to find without a retailer connection, a bit of luck, or some extra money to throw at it in the secondary market (or at retailer markup). Last yearâs bottles of Birthday Bourbon commanded the mid $100âs to as much as mid $200âs in the secondary, which isnât nearly as outrageous as other limited release bottlings but still in excess of what the bourbon inside the bottle warrants.Considering you can find 1920 Prohibition Style, which is a better bourbon produced by the same company for less money and significantly less stress, the only real reason to get your hands on Birthday Bourbon is because you just feel you have to have a bottle. I would buy it at MSRP or a bit more just because itâd be too hard to resist and the price is reasonable, but much more than that I would have doubts. Fortunately, we estimate a larger bottle count than last year - 18,600 up from 14,400 (a 29% increase), so finding a bottle should be a little easier.",September 2017,Old Forester 2017 Birthday Bourbon
168, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,101,12 Years, $100 (2018),"The slight bump in proof this year really shines through right from the beginning. Rich and deep, the nose on this year's edition continues the tradition of this series delivering a great experience. Sweet dark berries, caramel, brown sugar, and oak make for a dynamic mixture that impresses from first whiff. Beneath these scents lies a slight hint of spice, which blends nicely into the overall experience.","The sip itself is less viscous than one would expect after the rich nose. Despite the thinner mouthfeel, the sweet flavors still carry over nicely from the nose. Dark berries appear again and are joined by vanilla, baking chocolate, rye grain, and light oak. While good, the palate leaves you wishing that all the flavors had just a bit more of a pop than what they actually deliver.","The finish starts with a a touch of heat. Caramel, light oak, tobacco leaves, green pepper, and rye spice are predominant. The caramel and rye spice eventually drop off, leaving a pleasant mixture of oak and tobacco leaves. This finish lingers for a surprisingly lengthy amount of time.","Birthday Bourbon always has a distinct flavor profile from the rest of the Old Forester line. Aged longer than its siblings, the additional time in wood allows it to acquire a richer flavor profile that is distinctly different from the rest of the Old Forester lineup. It may not deliver the boldest experience of the lineup thanks to the ongoing release of Old Forester 1920, but the series delivers a rich experience that has yet to be duplicated in an ongoing Old Forester release.The proof increase this year is a welcome sight. It doesnât have as large of an impact on the depth of the palate as I was hoping for, but it nicely enhances both the nose and the finish. Itâs a trend Iâd like to see continue in future additions.","Over the last number of years, Brown-Forman has slowly been raising the price of their Old Forester Birthday Bourbon series. While the price held steady in 2017, it jumps up $20 this year marking the first time that the series hits the $100 mark. This now makes it the highest priced product bearing the Old Forester name. This also aligns it with the price point that Brown-Forman usually charges for their Woodford Masterâs Collection products.It can be painful to realize that this product cost almost half of its current MSRP just five years ago. However, many product's prices have increased steadily over the years, and itâs now commonplace for limited release products to be priced at $100 or more. Given this yearâs flavor profile, the $20 price increase is hard to complain about, since the whiskey delivers an experience that matches many of the great limited offerings weâve experienced in 2018.",September 2018,Old Forester 2018 Birthday Bourbon
169, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman, Brown-Forman Shively Distillery,105,11 Years, $100 (2019),"Warm and rich with inviting baking spices that are immediately noticeable. Inhaling deeper reveals oak, banana bread, vanilla, cinnamon bark, and a touch of summer fruits. While there is a hint of ethanol - which is unusual for Birthday Bourbon - it truthfully is this noses only slight flaw holding it back from being perfect. The scents mingle well and are fantastic overall, foreshadowing the sip to come.","Spice steps out front, with white pepper and light rye spice kicking off the sip. These flavors mingle with sweeter ones including vanilla, caramel, ripe melon, and a touch of honey. The spice and sweet flavors come together and balance one another well. The spice is the prominent part of the sip, yet the sweet flavors help tamper it down and result in a really nice mixture between the two contrasting flavor areas. ","Long and lingering. The sweet flavors from the sip quickly fade away as spice, white pepper, oak, and a hint of leather roar to the front. The spice brings with it a mouth-filling heat that lingers well after you swallow. Oak and leather lightly remain with the slightest touches of summer fruits and mint weaving in and out. Itâs not quite on par with the nose and palate, but still a nice way to round out the sip.","In 2018 Brown-Forman introduced the highest proof Old Forester Birthday Bourbon at the time. Coming in at 101 proof, 2018âs Old Forester Birthday Bourbon was really good, but  the depth of the palate didnât create the impact I was hoping for. However, it turns out that upping the proof just a few points, targeting a year younger, and moving down a floor in Warehouse I was the magic formula. Always a unique bottling, this yearâs edition seems to really deliver a pour that stands out from the crowd and certainly shows that higher proof Birthday Bourbon can be a great offering. The mixture of sweet and spice brings forth a sip with a lot of depth and one thatâs both approachable and very enjoyable.","For the first time in a number of years, the Old Forester Birthday Bourbon release has not seen a price increase, instead holding at its $100 price tag from the prior year. Maybe this was always the targeted price that Brown-Forman set when they started slowly raising the price a number of years ago. Staying at $100 firmly marks this in line with other limited releases on the market today. Unlike editions in recent years however, I feel like the value is actually present in the bottle this time around. In recent years Iâve found Old Forester Birthday Bourbon to be a really good sip, but I couldnât fully justify the ever increasing price hikes. For the first time since 2012 I think Iâve found an Old Forester Birthday Bourbon that truly lives up to the hype. The increased proof pulls forward a rush of various flavors throughout the sip that make it feel like you would gladly spend $100 on this series every year if the end result was like 2019âs edition. If Brown-Forman can hold its price point at $100 and continue to deliver the flavor profile found in this yearâs batch, many would agree that the value is there for your money.",,Old Forester 2019 Birthday Bourbon
170, Straight Rye,Brown-Forman,Old Forester,100,NAS, $23 (2019),"Floral aromas upfront integrate with sweet brown sugar and a citrusy zest. The floral notes seem unusual for a rye, bringing a unique yet subtle twist to the category.","A light hint of bananas is followed by a mixture of spices - cloves, allspice, and a trace of nutmeg. Cocoa and a faint nuttiness round it out, providing a well balanced and integrated sip. Itâs a tad light for the proofpoint, with less spice than I would have expected for a rye. Approachable and manageable, yet not quite as robust as the proof would suggest.","Initial peppercorn spice is overtaken by brown sugar sweetness, yielding a medium length finish that trends towards the sweeter side. Nothing about it is off-putting in any way, however it lacks the depth otherwise found on the nose and palate.","Such a high percentage of malted barley in a rye from a major distillery is unusual, as it typically ranges from about 4-12%. Generally speaking, malted barleyâs primary purpose in bourbon and rye mashbills is to aid in the fermentations process, serving as the primary source of sugars necessary for fermentation.Thinking of major distilleries, MGP Ingredients introduced a 51% rye, 49% malted barley mashbill in 2014, and while itâs likely made its way into a number of brands today, it is also likely blended with other mashbills and has not become commonplace as a standalone product. Last year Brown-Forman released Woodford Reserve Straight MaltWhiskey, which contains 51% malted barley. Other American whiskey distilleries experiment or even specialize in malt whiskey, sometimes using malt as much as 100% of the mashbill. While this is a growing category, it is still arguably uncommon. As evidence just look at your local retailerâs shelves - the percentage of American whiskey that would be classified as malt whiskey or even have an unusually high percentage of malt is relatively low.It may seem like a tangent to be focusing on malted barley when analyzing a rye, however its high percentage plays an obvious role in the flavor profile of this rye. While many ryes are âjust barelyâ rye at 51% rye along with a high percentage of corn, this rye is made from a 65% rye mashbill with 20% malted barley, and only 15% corn. What results is a rounder, softer flavor profile edging towards the characteristics that can be found in the growing American malt whiskey category. My guess is this is what contributes to the faint cocoa and nuttiness I noticed - flavors I rarely notice in rye whiskey. Overall this seemingly slight shift in mashbill away from the norm moves the needle just enough to yield a flavor profile that feels slightly new and different.","When completing the release date category in our classification section above, it is always refreshing to type âongoingâ for a new release. With a suggested price of $22.99, this lands squarely in todayâs value category. Because itâs new and will reach different markets at different times, there might a brief perception of a swell in demand, however I believe Brown-Forman intends this to  always be readily available. Notably, their press release says, âit plays beautifully in cocktails,â and the additional marketing pamphlet that arrived with the bottle dedicated half of its space to cocktail recipes. Its price combined with its relatively robust 100 proof point and less than edgy flavor profile suggests cocktails are not just an afterthought, but more what this whiskey was primarily designed for. It drinks well on its own, and I think few will dislike it. To that end, itâs priced quite well and an easy recommendation as something to mix or sip casually, depending on your audience.",February 2019/Ongoing,Old Forester Rye
171, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Old Forester Distilling Company,100,NAS, $30 (2019),"Sweet caramel and a cherry brightness spring from the glass, followed by ample amount of oak. This aroma is nicely balanced and inviting. It may not be overly complex, but its pleasantness makes up for it.","Bold oak, punchy pecans, and caramelized maple syrup drive home the richness of this sip. The mouthfeel however, is thinner than expected, based on the heft of the flavors. Thankfully this doesnât deter from the overall palate since the proof also does a lot to make up for it.","Pepper, clove, and seasoned oak get the spotlight during the finish. They fit well with the palateâs flavor profile and bring a bit more complexity to the finish. It unfortunately follows its non-Old Forester Whiskey Row bourbons and features an aftertaste thats mildly danky and overly oaked, resulting in a bitter taste. It tastes toned down from years past where it was overpowering. It doesnât derail the entire finish, but puts a blemish on an otherwise solid pour.","For the longest time the Old Forester brand suffered from brand identity. They have been one of the big boys on the shelf, but there just wasnât any excitement surrounding the brand. They offer Birthday Bourbon special release once a year, that until about five years ago, no one cared about. It wasnât much longer after that something began to change. They started showcasing Marianne Barnes as master distiller Chris Morrisâ protÃ©gÃ©e and let her loose on the first release in a new whiskey brand for the company, Whiskey Row. Fast forward a few years, Marianne Barnes is well know within the bourbon community and has since left to head up Castle & Key, and after four acclaimed Whiskey Row releases, the Old Forester brand finds themselves reinvigorated in their products, their snazzy downtown Louisville distillery, and overall brand perception. With a new brand-wide bottle label refresh in tow, Old Forester has changed and that is most apparent with Old Forester Signature 100 Proof. Still sporting the brandâs typical flavor profile, the bourbon overall tastes much more rich and full-flavored. Its 100 proof is spot-on providing warmth and intensity of flavors while still keeping it a gentle sipper. It might not be overly unique, but it is a much improved and higher quality pour than itâs been in a long time. It more closely resembles its more expensive and well-received Whiskey Row bourbons at a more introductory and everyday price. And most importantly of all, it's in a position to make a name for itself, by providing its competition with quality counterpoint. ","Not exactly a budget bourbon anymore as it creeps into the $30 range, Old Forester Signature will be an introductory bourbon to a lot of people, or an everyday bourbon to more seasoned drinkers. This price range comes with certain expectations though, like a more memorable flavor profile, that while not overly complex, still provides some flavor depth and sophistication. Evan Williams Single Barrel, Four Roses Small Batch, and Eagle Rare all accomplish this within this price range. Old Forester 86 and 100 proof bourbons have struggled with this for many years. They were far from bad bourbons, they just werenât all that memorable. Unfortunately what was most memorable about them was their dreadful finish. With this nearly fixed, and a rich palate and respectable depth, Old Forester Signature now provides a solid pour at a great price point.   ",,Old Forester Signature 100 Proof Bourbon
172, Straight Bourbon,Suntory Holdings,Jim Beam Distillery,114,NAS, $29 (2017),"This bourbon has some hair on its chest. Immediately youâre hit with cinnamon, brown sugar and rye heat.

A strong pop of crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e thatâs nicely mingled with notes of almond, and even slight hints of bubble gum. I would have liked the aromas to be a bit stronger mainly because of my enjoyment factor here. If youâre partial to crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, this nose is going to be hard to dislike since it plays such a prominent part of the flavor.","Minor notes of crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and almond from the nose continue into the palate, which are reinforced by slightly stronger notes of butterscotch and oak. The nose and palate work well blending complementary flavors together. Much like the nose, I would have liked a deeper, more prevalent breadth of flavors. As a result this whiskey is somewhat curbed by its thin palate. However, there is a chance that a stronger array of flavors might overpower the notable influence the nose contributes to this whiskeyâs palate.","Medium length with the slightest of burns. Minor oak notes swell then mellow, which complements this whiskeyâs palate well. No hint of youth on the finish despite containing 2 and 4 year old whiskeys. Faint hints of leather, toffee, and dried fruit on the backend, but not enough to make a lasting impact. Thereâs also a faint hint of custard on the tail end of the finish, but I wonder if itâs a lingering aroma influencing my tastebuds.","CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e is not unheard of as an element of a whiskeyâs flavor profile. I just canât think of any other whiskey that has it at such the forefront. It may turn some people off, but that could be said of any dominant flavor in a whiskey. In this case, I find it a refreshing departure and was certainly surprised by it. It is notable that this whiskey smells unlike any whiskey Iâve had before, and for many the custard aromas will probably be hard to dislike.","Before learning the price of this whiskey, I figured being a sourced whiskey from a company not widely known for their own brands, it would most likely command a higher-than-expected price. Few companies selling sourced whiskey are able to sell it at competitive prices against the big Kentucky distilleries. Priced at $30, Old Hickory Whiskey Black Label is within the realm of acceptability and in some ways can be applauded for its competitive pricing.

The sweet/spicy palate can be interesting if you pay enough attention to it.,"At $50 a bottle itâs overpriced, plain and simple. It's no doubt a quality bourbon, but it isnât unique enough to warrant being priced on the high side of bourbonâs pricing curve.

The nose is quite expressive for an 80 proof whiskey. Minor notes of oak and rye spice are also present, but barely make an impact over the sweet aromas.","The palate is extremely thin and watery with a very basic composition. Itâs hard to readily pick out any flavors due to them being so diluted. There are faint traces of leather, cinnamon, and orange, but theyâre weak and muddled.","The same flavors that are present in the palate ramp up a notch on the finish, but quickly fade, barely leaving a trace they were even there. For a brief moment these flavors show some hope before they quickly evaporate. Itâs a shame since that moment isnât all that bad.","Old Overholt has been a mainstay in bars for as long as anyone can remember. It amazes me this is commonly used as a mixing whiskey since its lack of boldness couldnât possibly stand up to any mixing agent. Of course that can probably be said of any rail spirit a bar uses. The whiskey does deserve some credit, despite it only being three years old, it doesnât have the typical young, harsh taste to it that many young whiskeys do. But how often do you see or hear anyone ordering up an Old Overholt neat? Itâs expected for an 80 proof whiskey to be mild, but I canât remember one that was this thin and lacking so much character. As a result this is probably the smoothest and easiest drinking whiskey Iâve ever had. Of course you might be able to say that about any whiskey if you dumped enough water into it. This is a common complaint of 80 proof whiskeys, but Old Overholtâs lack of character in particular seems to exemplify this. The brand might have an interesting history, but in its current state, this is truly one of the most boring whiskeys I've ever had.","The brandâs longevity and placement in many bars is probably the result of its price: Itâs cheap. Itâs one of the least expensive ryes on the market. For some thatâs important, but for a few dollars more, Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond is the better buy. This might be why Beam released a bottled in bond version of Old Overholt Rye that's aged an additional year. At 80 proof, Old Overholt has little to offer. Itâs not that every whiskey has to shoot for the moon in hopes to satisfy every whiskey drinker, but Old Overholt can barely get off the ground.",Ongoing,Old Overholt Rye
176, Straight Bourbon,"Sazerac Company, Inc.",Buffalo Trace,107,NAS (Said to be around 7 years), $30 (2016),It comes off a bit thin at first but then a tidal wave of flavor and heat hit that even affects your nose. It feels like youâre sipping a barrel proof bourbon without the high proof attached to it. It has moments of sweetness mixed in that is countered with an alcohol bite.  A hot and full flavor affair.,"This where the oak shines through. A delicious combination of char and spice that doesnât overstay its welcome. The wheat sweetness is still present, but a measured blast of heat will let you know itâs there as it goes down. The semi dry finish isnât overly complex but it has a decent amount of weight to it that helps balance the whole package.","Besides being one of the few wheated bourbons on the marketplace, oak verses age is the name of the game here. It's age falls around the 7 year range and has more oak flavor than many similar aged bottles on sale today. Whatever magic Buffalo Trace uses to accomplish this certainly make it unique to Weller Antique. The nose on each of the W.L. Weller bourbons (12 Year, Special Reserve, Antique) are  surprisingly great. Combined with a robust palate, Weller Antique is easily comparable to bourbons twice its price.","Again and again, the W.L. Weller line is one of the best values in bourbon. Old Weller Antique tastes like a bourbon that is much older than it is and can even taste a lot like a barrel proof bourbon. All of this with a MSRP under $25.This is also a bourbon that shares the same mashbill, warehouse and proof as Old Rip Van Winkle 10 year. Given the choice, I would always choose Old Weller Antique. Its younger age maintains a more agreeable amount of oak and has a price point that is easy of the wallet.","As with most things in life, itâs about putting it into perspective. People see high marks for the Weller line, try it and arenât immediately blown away. Old Weller Antique, like its other Weller brothers, are surprisingly complex bourbons for their age and price. Sometimes you might have to spend a few extra minutes and sips to fully appreciate what the Weller brand offers. Old Weller Antique because of its spice and heat may not be for everyone. But if you're looking for a bourbon with a little more kick without getting into very high proof bourbons then this is a great place to start.",Ongoing,Old Weller Antique Bourbon
177, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,110,7-8 Years, $90 (2018),"Traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel upfront that are quickly washed over with a wave of orange soda, candied fruits, and mild barrel char. Its medium intensity of aromas are a bit strange at first, yet not alarmingly so, as the orange notes are certainly unique and welcoming. Itâs worth pointing out that its aromas intensify in a more open air glass than a traditional glencairn. Something I havenât noticed with other bourbons to this degree.","A flash of orange marmalade, orange sponge candy, slight bitterness, and sugary alcoholic bite instantly reminds me of Grand Marnier. Seasoned oak and hearty vanilla notes roll in, bumping out the majority of the Orange CuraÃ§ao barrel finish. Itâs an enjoyable mingling that I canât help but feelis a little too short and lacking complexity.","Seasoned oak and vanilla notes carry over into the finish and dominate. Sugary orange notes weave throughout, but struggle to really pop. As the heartier bourbon and barrel notes subside, orange marmalade becomes more noticeable again and nicely caps this bourbon off.","Itâs hard to discuss this barrel finish without mentioning Willett XCF V1.0. Released in 2015, XCF was a 103 proof, 7 year old rye finished in orange curaÃ§ao barrels for approximately 90 days. With similar ages both in their base whiskeys and their finishing time, itâs interesting how different XCF and Parkerâs are from each other.XCF comes off as a bottled old fashioned cocktail in many ways. The Orange CuraÃ§ao notes pop and do well mingling with its rye base. The XCFâs age and lack of barrel notes helps brighten its barrel influence more so than the Parkerâs. Yet, it also lacks depth and makes you wonder if Orange CuraÃ§ao barrels have this effect on all whiskeys or if these whiskeys just werenât finished long enough.In the end, tasting a whiskey with orange flavor notes really stands out. A whiskey might sport minor orange notes from time to time, but none to the degree that XCF and Parkerâs showcase. Orange can be an overpowering flavor and it must take a ton of skill to nail it just right. Thankfully this edition of Parkerâs does a good job controlling the intensity of its orange flavor without letting it do just that. Where the rye and orange notes were playful with each other in the XCF, the bourbon notes of the Parkerâs helps ground this whiskey. Itâs hard to say which is the better route to take, but quit easy to revel in its uniqueness.","With Parkerâs fluctuating in pricing over the last few years, itâs nice to see this priced under $100 again this year. I get the sense that sourcing Orange CuraÃ§ao barrel isnât cheap or easy. For one, XCF was priced at $140 in 2015, and two, XCF was the last Orange CuraÃ§ao barrel finished whiskey to come to market since its release. $90 still might be a high asking price for a type of barrel finished whiskey that doesnât have a long proven track record, but you never get the sense that Heaven Hill uses subpar whiskey in these releases. Even though we havenât loved every Parkerâs release, weâve never claimed any were straight up bad either. This yearâs Parkerâs has a solid bourbon as its base in addition to its unique barrel finish, all for the same price the company charged for a Parkerâs release in 2014.",September 2018,Parker's Heritage Collection:  Bourbon Finished in Orange CuraÃ§ao Barrels
178, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,122,11 Years, $130 (2017),"A potent yet still somewhat understated nose for a 122 proof bourbon. Bountiful notes of tobacco, raisins, caramel, and cherry make this bourbon a delight to nose. Trace amounts of ethanol and bitterness are also present, but are overpowered by heavier oak notes. Itâs certainly an enjoyable nose, but there is something about it that makes it come up a little short. It just might be that the combination of them doesnât quite mingle together perfectly or as well as they should.","Heavy notes of oak, tobacco, and cinnamon come blasting to the forefront of the sip. The proof is evident, as a strong blast of heat comes immediately. After the heat subsides, a creamy consistency materializes along with faint notes of candy corn, baking spice, and fireball candy. It leans more on pomp and circumstance than delicate and sophisticated.","Itâs a bit baffling and surprising how straightforward this finish is coming from a Parkerâs release. Heavy notes of oak dominate with a healthy amount of dryness. Itâs a bit too powerful tasting for its own good, as too many of the palateâs flavors get completely drowned out by the heat in the finish. Adding water helps tame the heat, but does little to enhance the flavor.","Heaven Hill manages to release a notably different Parkerâs Heritage Collection product every year, yet they never get labeled as âexperimentalâ or âgimmicky.â A lot of this has to do with the Collection being grounded in types of releases you might see from any other distillery, except Parkerâs has an incredible track record that few in the industry can match.At one time, an 11 year old bourbon was nothing special. Nowadays as age statements have all but disappeared, it can be easily considered a special release. Many of Parkerâs releases fall under the âdonât judge a book by its coverâ category. On paper they seem like nothing special. Itâs not until you try them that the bigger picture is revealed. This yearâs Parkerâs flavor profile isnât revolutionary, but it isnât boring either. Itâs somewhere in the middle and that has worked for the series before. Usually this is saved by the fact that Parkerâs is routinely an very-above-average tasting product. Thatâs partly true this year too, but for once Iâm not sure if itâs enough. It does have a interesting mingling of flavors and the quality is there, but it doesnât quite come together as well as it should.","Year after year Parkerâs tends to be priced right on the pulse of what limited editions should be priced at. That hasnât always been the case for consumers. Take for example the last five releases. Plenty complained about $80 for 2012âs Blend of Mashbills, $90 for 2013âs Promise of Hope and 2014âs Wheat Whiskey, $100 for 2015âs Malt Whiskey, and $250 for 2016âs 24 Year Bottled In Bond Bourbon. You might not have been willing to pay MSRP for those whiskeys at the time, but in hindsight they all come across as pretty reasonably priced.This yearâs Parkerâs at $130 for an 11 year old single barrel bourbon seems a bit excessive for anyone who has been drinking bourbon for more than a few years. Much like the response Promise of Hope received for being a 10 year old single barrel bourbon, it seems like a high price to pay for what the label says. In Promise of Hopeâs case, what was in the bottle certainly warranted its price. Unfortunately, I canât say the same thing about this 11 Year. Itâs higher proof combined with the Collectionâs track record provided hope, but ultimately it suffers the same fate as many recent limited edition bourbons over the past year or two - whatâs in the bottle just isnât all that magical. Yes the 11 Year is a good bourbon, but much like the reception Knob Creek and Wild Turkey received with their special editions over the past few years, itâs just not good enough to warrant the price or memorable enough to make you want to revisit it over and over.",October 2017,Parker's Heritage Collection: 11 Year Single Barrel
179, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Old Heaven Hill Springs Distillery,100,24 Years, $250 (2016),"Light intensity with woody components throughout. Off-smelling seasoned wood combines with allspice and a trace of ethanol to create a delicate spice. Inhaling with more intensity I get very light traces of burnt sawdust and freshly cut wood. The scents are intriguing, but donât make for an overly welcome invitation to take a sip.","Seasoned wood comes first, leaning more towards rich than spicy. While it starts off dry, a torrent of heavy, aged oak brings a mouth-coating viscosity along with it. A hint of burnt s'mores sweetness mingles with black pepper and allspice towards the end. With the exception of the initial dryness, thereâs a âsoggyâ flavor characteristic throughout, like funky, dank musty old wood, but itâs not as awful as it sounds. It makes for an interesting, albeit strange, experience.","Medium to long, it starts with some bitterness from the seasoned wood, but transitions to sweet with a bit of chocolate towards the end. Not surprisingly, soggy oak characteristics dominate at the start, but they find some balance against light cinnamon and black pepper spice, which are eventually overtaken by the sweetness. This combination succeeds at leaving a nice last impression.","Iâve always thought the more unique a bourbon tastes, the more polarizing it will be among drinkers. This is no exception. The Parkerâs Heritage Collection is different every year, often pushing the envelope on concept and style. Close in age, the second edition of the Collection was a little older at 27 years, but it was more balanced, possibly due in part to its lower proofpoint and no doubt barrel selection.This 24 year old 100 proof Bottled in Bond edition is, at its core, a unique example of how bourbon thatâs aged well beyond the more common 4-12 year time frame can ultimately taste. Recent comparisons include the high-aged Orphan Barrels, Evan Williams 23 Year, and the annual Pappy Van Winkle 23 Year, which few will have the opportunity to taste. Probably most comparable and widely released is Heaven Hillâs own Elijah Craig 23 Year, and of course the other high aged bourbons in the series. While Iâd describe my last taste of the Elijah Craig 23 Year as an oak bomb, Parkerâs 10th goes a different route. With its characteristic âsogginess,â itâs as if the barrels aging Parkerâs didnât experience a tremendous amount of evaporation loss, but rather retained a good amount of moisture over the years. Maybe the barrels themselves were a bit more soggy as they aged, retaining more water than usual due to their specific location in the rickhouse. Iâm just speculating about all of this, but given the resulting flavor profile, I canât help but think there may have been a unique aging situation at play. In any event, this is a 100 proof 24 year old Bottled in Bond bourbon with a characteristically unusual flavor profile, leaving few comparables out there.","The value proposition with limited releases is a tricky one, as lack of continuous supply ultimately means scarcity will become reality sooner or later. The concept of scarcity has become a carefully manufactured marketing tool for some of the companies behind todayâs releases, but marketing is not always to blame. While Iâm certainly not privy to Heaven Hillâs bourbon stocks, the idea that this particular release is truly limited and theyâre running low on quality high aged stock doesnât seem far fetched.The Parkerâs Heritage Collection has generally been met with mixed feelings, and as a result, seems more attainable at MSRP than other high profile limited releases. The 10th edition is no exception. At $250 out of the gate, itâs no bargain but certainly not outlandish by todayâs standards considering itâs age, unique flavor profile, âpre-fireâ status, and most notably what consumers seem to be willing to pay for the exclusivity theyâll enjoy in owning a bottle.But taste matters. An impressive whiskey on paper, thereâs more value here in the form of a collectorâs item than as a bourbon with a must-have flavor profile. While Iâm always one for opening and sharing, I canât get behind the price tag for any reason other than to own a piece of history. If you think you might really enjoy this release, youâll be better served trying before buying at this price point or at its even higher going rate on the secondary market. Considering its $250 MSRP as a starting point, even trying is going to cost you, so be prepared to pay in order to satisfy your curiosity.",September 2016,Parker's Heritage Collection: 24 Year Bottled in Bond
180, Malt Whiskey,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,108,8 Years, $100 (2015),"A gentle mix of maple, leather, and pine lie underneath an umbrella of pronounced oak. Itâs surprising how much oak is coming off of the nose for a whiskey thatâs been aged 8 years. At the same time, I donât feel it overshadows any of the other aromas. In fact, they all mingle quite well. Much of this has to do with the oak having a cool, almost mintiness to it. This creates an interesting effect of the oak notes being strong, yet mellow at the same time. This is definitely one of the more unique noses on a whiskey Iâve smelled in some time.","If you haven't had a lot of experience with American malt whiskeys, this one might be a little bit of a shock for you. While it has flavor similarities to bourbon, thereâs no confusing the two. Light notes of toffee and butterscotch are present alongside notes of grass and cedar. Even though the mashbill consists of 65% malt, the sweetness from the corn still pulls through. This creates an interesting interplay between the sweet and oak notes. Overall the palateâs flavors are on the mellow side, which makes it very drinkable, though I do wish it had more richness in its flavors. It might not be a very complex palate, but all of the flavors do an ample job of standing out on their own.","At 108 proof, the finish is surprisingly smooth and very drinkable. It rapidly expands and contracts in your mouth and then lingers for a good amount of time afterwards. Oak once again dominates, but the other flavors from the palate blend together and help counter the oakâs at-times brashness. This is everything Forged Oak wanted to be but failed to deliver. Itâs a nice oak-foward finish with just the right amount of accompanying flavors to produce a satisfying conclusion.","There arenât many American distilleries releasing malt whiskeys in the States with Stranahanâs and Balcones being the most well known. More often than not they are from craft distilleries trying to make a name for themselves by releasing a unique product to the market. The main complaints levied against them are the whiskeysâ young ages, lack of developed palate, and inadequate oak notes in their flavor profiles.When Heaven Hill announced earlier in the year that the next release in their celebrated Parkerâs Heritage Collection would be a malt whiskey, it was certainly a shock to most. Many enthusiasts expected this next iteration to be a rye whiskey, as the collection is known for variations on the company's existing products. So to have one of Kentuckyâs big boy distilleries announce a malt whiskey, it was instantly greeted with puzzlement and worry that this yearâs bottle wouldnât live up to the collectionâs high standards.If American malt whiskey makers use this yearâs Parkerâs release as a benchmark for their own products, whiskey drinkers will have a lot to celebrate. This is one of the more genuinely unique products to come out on the American market in some time. A lot of this currently has to do with the lack of depth in this particular market segment. Thereâs simply not a lot of high(er) aged American malt whiskeys for sale. Having a mashbill consisting of 65% malt and 35% corn also provides a best of both worlds flavor profile that will taste familiar and unusual at the same time. When you then include the whiskeyâs intriguing interplay of sweet and oak notes that also mixes in earthy and minty notes, itâs hard to say youâve tasted anything like it.","The Parkerâs Heritage Collection is hands down one of the most interesting releases each year. You may not love every single release, but the company makes it very hard to complain about the overall quality. I never get the feeling with this collection that Iâm paying to taste test an experiment some master distiller came up with on a whim. There have been too many products over the past few years that felt like they were in-house experiments that should have never seen the retail shelves. You may not love every Parkerâs Heritage Collection release, but youâd be hard pressed to call them subpar in the quality department.That said, the brandâs $100 MSRP is right on the money as what these releases should cost. Depending on how much you love the individual release, you either feel like you got your moneyâs worth or you simply donât care for the particular release. Never do you feel like you got ripped off with a Parkerâs Heritage Collection special release, and thatâs a rarity these days. With many of the American malt whiskeys on the market falling in the $50-$75 range and aged 2-5 years, the price for this Parkerâs release is certainly within the realm of acceptability, especially when you factor in its age and overall quality.",September 2015,Parker's Heritage Collection: Malt Whiskey
181, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,96,10 Years, $90 (2014),"A perfectly balanced, sweet smelling nose. Hints of fruits and spice, enhanced with oak. Caramelized sugar, honey and maple stand out the most. They should make a cologne that smells like this.","A very complex splash of flavors when it hits the tongue. Caramelized sugar and apples, with dashes of sweet honey and maple syrup. It tastes much like it smells, which doesnât always happen with bourbon.","As it settles on the back of your tongue, oak characteristics come into play. Caramel also begin to pull out over the sugars. A perfect amount of burn develops to finish off the experience, though it ends a bit quicker than expected.","A truly balanced bourbon is hard to come by. Many bourbons strive for it. Many fail and instead begin to focus on gimmicks. When Parker Beam and Heaven Hill released what their 2013 Parkerâs Heritage would be, it didnât immediately spark a tidal wave of interest like previous years. Weâve all been promised balanced, well rounded bourbon before. Maybe after too many disappointments itâs hard to get excited about it. Arguably, there are only a few bourbons on the market that begin to reach this level: Four Roses and E.H. Taylor continue to impress year after year, Buffalo Trace Antique Collection maintains high quality and for those lucky enough to find a bottle, Pappy Van Winkles do. Balanced bourbon is a pipe dream, or so we thought. Promise of Hope is unique in that regard. It talks the talk and surprisingly, walks the walk.","Let it be said: $90-$100 for a 10 year old bourbon is a bit crazy. There are many bourbons on the market at the same age for a third to half the price. Why then would anyone take a second glance at Parkerâs Promise of Hope? This may be the closest we get to a perfect bourbon. Yes, that is high praise, yet the bourbon can back that claim. Promise of Hope is as balanced as bourbons come (in 2013). Any bourbon priced near a Franklin has the cards stacked against it. This is one reveals a full house.",Fall 2013,Parker's Heritage Collection: Promise of Hope
182, Wheat Whiskey,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,"126.8 (this is the 2nd batch, the first was 127.4 proof)",13 Years, $90 (2014),"Upon opening this for the first time it revealed very little of anything on the nose. After the bottle sat for a week or so the whiskey seems to have come alive, with a more intense mix of scents albeit still more faint than I had expected. Thereâs some caramel and vanilla in there. Alcohol is present, with something coming through that I just canât seem to put my finger on. It almost has a baking bread kind of smell, but what kind Iâm not sure.","I could guzzle this stuff. One of the best âPalatesâ in whiskey this year. The sip is delightful and full of flavor and warmth. Itâs surprisingly smooth for the proof on the palate, but still has the intensity youâd expect from a barrel proof whiskey. Itâs sweet, but not the same kind of sweet as a bourbon with a high amount of corn in the mash bill. The sweetness is softened by the taste of rich, warm bread just out of the oven. There's some grain and honey in there too. Itâs downright delicious.","The burn intensifies quite dramatically as I swallow, developing a spicy intensity on the tongue and moving into the back of the throat. It lingers for a bit, but the flavors dissipate rather quickly along with the burn. Itâs a good burn and maybe even too much for some. Considering the deliciousness of the palate itâs surprisingly not as balanced as Iâd hoped.","A wheat whiskey aged 13 years is pretty damn unique. I love the fact that the annual Parkerâs Heritage releases are completely different from year to year, and this is the first non-bourbon Parkerâs Heritage release so far. Weâve also got the âWheatedâ Makerâs Mark Cask Strength and annual BTAC William Larue Weller to compare this to, a trifecta of delicious whiskeys even if the later two are just wheated bourbons... maybe a topic for a future Breaking Bourbon Face Off. I will say this, it shows much more intensity and character when sipped next to the Makerâs Mark Cask Strength, which is also very enjoyable. Despite the interesting technicals, I didnât find the flavor profile quite as unique as Iâd anticipated. It still echoes the same traits as a bourbon, and although the flavor profile has its own unique traits, I cannot say I would have identified it as a wheat whiskey in a blind taste test.","This is a good deal. Itâs a quality whiskey right up there with the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, albeit maybe not quite as balanced in a nose - palate - finish sense. Itâs MSRP is also a little higher than BTAC, although not as high as Wild Turkey Diamond Anniversary. Itâs certainly not cheap, but for $90 (you may see this in the $80 - $100 range) this is definitely one of the yearâs releases you should seek out.",Fall 2014,Parker's Heritage Collection: Wheat Whiskey
183, Straight Rye	 ,Heaven Hill	,Heaven Hill,105,8 Years,,"Rye spice and barrel char best characterize the nose, however they have to fight through a wall of ethanol heat to make their presence known. A trace amount of caramel peeks through as well, adding a sweet element to the mix. The heat overshadows the other scents making for a meek showing and overall aroma that's subpar and uninviting.","Heat up front gives way to dark fruits and leather followed by a crescendo of spice. Itâs nearly one dimensional, with heat and spice taking the forefront against the other flavors present. Because of this, it tastes hotter than its 105 proof and not in an enjoyable way. While it isnât downright bad, the impression Iâm left with is a slightly negative one.","Flavors open up in the finish, with caramel, baking spices, seasoned oak, and clove coming forward with ferocity. Rye spice slowly comes back into play without the accompanying heat present before, making for a nicely balanced sweet-spice combination that lingers for some time. Itâs the most complex part of the sip, and while it doesnât necessarily provide enough oomph to make up for the other shortcomings, it does end the sip on a positive note.","Heaven Hill produces what would appear to be a very similar whiskey, Pikesville Rye. It shares the same mashbill and is only 5 proof points higher at 110, however itâs a little younger at 6 years old and is aged in Heaven Hillâs more standard Level 3 charred barrels. It retails for around $55 and is considered a premium quality rye at its price point. Exploring other distilleries reveals the typical char level used is between char levels 3 and 4. While the exact burn time might vary a bit by distillery or barrel cooper, the range is relatively small and could rightly be described as the âsweet spot.â Higher char levels have certainly been used in experimentation, and likely are being used on a smaller scale on a more regular basis. One example that comes to mind is a Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection, â#7 Heavy Char Barrel,â in which 7 barrels were charred for 3.5 minutes and then bourbon Mash #2 was aged in the barrels for over 15 years. Notably, Buffalo Trace has not switched to #7 charred barrels as a result of that experiment.The resulting flavor profile of the Parkerâs Heavy Char Barrels Rye is unremarkable. It drinks hotter than 105 proof, and taking Parkerâs Rye 5 proof points down from Pikesville Rye suggests it was too hot at a higher proof. I assume Heaven Hill would have known many would compare it side by side with Pikesville Rye looking for notable attributes that would suggest a higher value, such as a higher proof point, decreasing the proof as a necessity to keep the heat in check.","As noted, this release shares a number of similarities with Heaven Hillâs Pikesville Rye, a regularly available premium whiskey offered at $55. Parkerâs contrasts Pikeville by adding two years and Level 5 charred barrels, however that difference from a value perspective is nominal. For nearly triple the cost, I would expect the flavor profile to carry the majority of the weight from a value perspective.I approached this open-minded believing it was possible. Eight years old for a rye can be a sweet spot, as can around 100 proof. I thought of the 2013 release as a comparison: Parkerâs Heritage Promise of Hope, which was essentially Henry McKenna offered at 4 proof points lower and for nearly triple the price at the time. It too seemed a bit over-the-top at first...until I tried it. Immediately I knew it was something special despite its relatively unimpressive stats.Comparing further, itâs worth noting 2018 Parkerâs Heritage Collection - Bourbon Finished in Orange Curacao Barrels, was offered at a $90 MSRP. 2011 Parkerâs Heritage - 11 Year Single Barrel (122 proof), was offered at $130 MSRP. This pricing would suggest something close to $90-$100 for 2019âs release might be appropriate and on par with Heaven Hillâs historical pricing structure for this series. Given the change in the market and corresponding $150 MSRP, I assumed this yearâs release might have the same magic as Promise of Hope, and tripling the price of its closest counterpart (Pikesville Rye) was certainly pushing it, but not necessarily unreasonable. Unfortunately the taste isnât anywhere near what I would expect for a special limited release whiskey with a $150 MSRP, a massive let-down given my expectations. Taking this into account, my opinion on value is much more clear. $150 is overpriced by a long-shot. I canât fault Heaven Hill for wanting to elevate their brand portfolio into more premium pricing territory as we are starting to see. But just because you can, doesnât mean you should. The logic that can be applied to one bottle in a portfolio cannot necessarily be applied to another. I do appreciate the fact that some of the proceeds are being donated to the ALS Association. In the past this has ranged from $10-$20 per bottle depending on the edition starting with 2013âs Promise of Hope release. However the amount per bottle donated with this edition is unknown, and likely not enough to warrant such an increase in price over expectation given whatâs inside the bottle.

184, Straight Rye,Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company,Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company,108,2 Years, $125 (2017),"The nose smells youthful but still flavorful. Fresh oak, banana, and corn lead the way. Behind this are slight hints of vanilla, rye, pine, and anise. These are mixed with an ever present hint of ethanol throughout. Overall the nose isnât a standout, yet itâs still a pleasant introduction.","Sweet and spicy flavors all wrapped into one. The rye initially hits your lips with a sweeter flavor profile before exploding into a spicy blast as it envelops your mouth. Brown sugar and vanilla are followed by a mixture of rye spice, oak, pepper, and a touch of peaches. Heat is a constant factor throughout the palate, however it isnât overbearing and if anything, it helps to enhance the flavors and even slightly hides the ryeâs youthfulness. Surprisingly it doesnât taste like a rye thatâs only been in the barrel for 24 months, however it also doesnât punch much above that age range either.","Corn and oak lead the way followed by dabs of leather, rye grain, and vanilla. The finish is slightly dry and ever so tannic. Lingering hints of new oak and dashes of smoke stay present long after the sip ends.","Peerless tries to distinguish itself from its peers through the use of a new sweet mash with every batch, low barrel entry proof (107 proof), small batching (only 6 barrels at a time), and by using barrels from smaller cooperages. They also use a high-end looking bottle, which convey a classic yet fresh look. While all these traits are unique in relation to their competition, Peerless fails to differentiate itself on the part that counts, its flavor profile.The whiskey shows a good deal of promise, yet it still tastes like a relatively young, high proof rye when it comes down to it. It has just enough new oak taste to remind you that itâs young, with just enough complexity to show you that it may turn into something great in the future. In the meantime, youâre left with a perfectly fine rye to sip and wonder âjust how did they do it?â but in the end it just doesnât really stand out from many other ryes on the market.","Peerless is a newly revived distillery out of Kentucky selling their young distillate. If this story sounds familiar, it should. Just a few short years ago this exact same headline could have applied to Willett as they released their own 2 year aged distillate. The differences though end right there. Not even taking into account Willettâs unique flavor profile, whatâs incredibly different is the fact that Willett priced their rye under $40 versus the $100+ price tag that Peerless chose.The fact of the matter is, Peerless Rye does not live up to its price tag. $100+ for a 2 year rye is absurd unless itâs one of the best ryes on the market. Yes this rye shows potential, but pricing on potential isnât enough, even in todayâs marketplace. If youâre going to spend over a $100 on a rye, I would be remiss if I didnât suggest to spend a few dollars more for Kentucky Owl Rye, which is similar in proof and aged an extra 9 years. If you canât find an Owl or donât want to pay $100 or more but are still looking for a high proof rye, Pikesville 6 Year Rye is another good bet. Yes theyâre different flavor profiles, but both deliver a much better drinking experience than Peerless does.",Spring 2017,Peerless Straight Rye Whiskey 2 Year
185, Straight Rye,Heaven Hill,Bernheim Distillery,110,6 Year, $50 (2016),"A nice mix of sweet and spicy. Cherry syrup, rye spice, red licorice and cinnamon apple float up from the glass. Thereâs a hint of ethanol present that reminds me this is 110 proof, however it doesnât distract from the experience. Instead, all of the flavors co-mingle nicely and produce a very satisfying nose.","Cherry is the name of the game with this palate. Cherry cola is immediately present along with the cherry syrup from the nose. Layered beneath are hints of rye spice, vanilla, and summer fruits. This is a rye thatâs easy to sip due to its sweeter flavor profile and due to the fact that it tends to drink at a lower proof than it actually is. Itâs not the most complex rye out there, but it has a really enjoyable palate that had me going back for more and more.","Rye spice, vanilla, and cherry are immediately noticeable. Upfront the finish contains a nice amount of heat that slowly expands and creeps its way down my throat. As the finish lingers on, a subtle amount of oak makes its way forward along with that familiar cherry syrup taste thatâs present in the nose and palate. While not very complex, it provides a nice pleasant endcap.","The fairest comparison to this rye is with its little brother, Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond. Many people theorize that Pikesville is Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond Rye that has been aged an extra two years and bottled at an additional 10 proof points. This would explain the slight similarity in fruitiness experienced in both, but thatâs where the similarities end. While they both may potentially share the same mash bill, Pikesville delivers a whole new unique flavor profile that to me, is more enjoyable than Rittenhouse. This isnât to say that Rittenhouse is lacking, instead it speaks to the fact that Pikesville builds off of Rittenhouseâs foundation and takes it to the next level.Pikesvilleâs true uniqueness comes into play by the fact that it fills in a hole in the marketplace. Bourbon drinkers have been spoiled over the last few years with the outstanding selection of options we have in the marketplace, especially when it comes to higher proof whiskeys. However, up until now there hasnât been a greater than 100 proof rye that is easily accessible and available year round. The key word being accessible and available year round. While Redemption Rye produces a barrel proof version of their rye and Buffalo Trace produces Thomas Handy, neither is easily accessible throughout the year.","Pikesville comes in at double the price of Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond. While this is a steep price to pay for what is essentially two additional aging years and 10 additional proof points, Pikesville does deliver a more refined experience. This is not a knock against Pikesville, but more of a nod to Rittenhouse Bottled-in-Bond for being a fine rye in and of itself at a really affordable price point.The thing about the rye marketplace is that itâs easy for a product to carve out its niche even in a price range where thereâs competition. And Pikesville does face some competition in this price range from other quality ryes such as High Westâs Rendezvous Rye, Double Rye barrel aged variants and even E.H. Taylor Rye. While these ryes might offer more complexity and depth, what Pikesville brings to the table is a really easy to drink, full-flavored rye with a less polarizing flavor profile than others in the category. Even in the oversaturated world of bourbons this is a hard quality to find, with a comparable example being Blantonâs Single Barrel bourbon. In fact, in a way, Pikesville does for ryes what Blantonâs Single Barrel does for bourbons; high quality, mass appeal, decent accessibility at a fair price.",Ongoing,Pikesville Rye 6 Year
186, Straight Bourbon,CJS Beverage Corp. ,MGP,115.3,3 years, $50 (2019),"Light but lively, candied orange and white cake nicely blend together. Theyâre joined by a touch of vanilla, light oak, and pepper. A light layer of ethanol lies in wait, and appears with a heavy sniff. A nice way to start off the sip.","The palate is slightly youthful and a stark contrast from the nose. Where the nose is mostly sweet, the palate is a bold spicy burst of rye that really shines through. It combines with a mixture of nuts, oak, black pepper, and a touch of sweet vanilla. Itâs surprising how much the rye shines through for the percentage in the mix, but the end result is a bold palate that surprises with each sip.","The finish starts with a touch of warming heat as the rye spice carries through. Additionally, there is a brief hint of vanilla and peaches to start the finish. These fade leaving straw, oak, and leather on the backend. The finish ends on a lingering spicy rye and dry leather note. While itâs a perfectly nice way to end, it's also the weakest part of the sip by comparison.","A cask strength bourbon in and of itself isnât anything overly unique. Sure a nod should be given to Pinhook for offering Bourbon Country in standard, single barrel and cask strength versions, however this wouldnât be the first time this was done. Makers allows this on a larger scale with their Makerâs & Maker's 46 lines, which come in standard, cask strength, and single barrel versions through single barrel selections that stores/groups do.What makes Pinhook Bourbon Country Cask Strength really unique in my book is the interplay between the bright fresh sweet nose and the bold spicy palate. Theyâre so contrasting from each other and unexpected that it brings forth an experience so rarely seen in a cask strength bourbon. This contrast also plays well for the youth of this bourbon, as it  masks the young age more than you would normally find for a bourbon this age. No matter how many times I sipped this, I was still surprised each time the transition happened. In a sea full of commonplace cask strength bourbons, itâs a nice change to experience.","Bourbon Country Cask Strength may seem expensive for a bourbon aged three years, in reality, itâs priced accordingly in todayâs marketplace. It competes in the same price range that youâll find bourbons such as Bulleit Barrel Strength, and for a few dollars less than what a bottle of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof generally sells for. While it depends on the batch of Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, generally speaking Bourbon Country falls neatly in between these two lines sipwise and is priced accordingly. The fair price lends to the fact that you can pair this with either a single barrel version of Bourbon Country or the standard version for $100 or less, for a fun and reasonably priced face off.",,Pinhook Bourbon Country Cask Strength
187, Straight Rye,CJS Beverage Corp.,"MGP Ingredients, Inc.",93.5, NAS (aged at least 24 months), $38 (2018),"A familiar MPG rye scent is present but with a twist. Light rye spice is immediately noticeable but not the main focus. Additional notes of summer fruits are mixed in with lighter notes of hay, brown sugar, cherry, and a tad of cinnamon apple. While the scents are lighter, itâs surprising how much they pull you in for a two year old rye. Quite enjoyable.","Bourbon N Rye has a sweet, slightly oily mouthfeel full of fruit flavors, orange and citrus being the most prominent. The sip also presents new oak, a tad of rye spice, vanilla, and white pepper. For a 95% rye, itâs sweeter than expected.","The finish is quite the opposite of the nose and palate. Gone are the sweet flavors of fruits, and instead is dry from start to finish starting with faint vanilla, heavy leather and oak/rye spice. Additional notes of light tobacco and nuts are present. For such a young rye, itâs surprising how dry and woody this is. Overall the finish is pretty short and fades pretty quickly.","Sourced MGP rye isnât anything groundbreaking. Itâs usually pretty consistent and delivers a decent sip. Whatâs surprising for Pinhookâs first foray into rye is that they were able to pull out a sweeter flavor profile in their blend. Normally this would be considered a downfall seeing as the sweetness masks the young age of this rye, but here itâs actually a plus. If you prefer older ryes this probably wonât hold a candlestick to them for you, but it would do excellent against other two year variants.Additionally, this is a fruity rye in a similar vein to Rittenhouse Rye. While a fruity non-traditional rye profile is normally not what Iâm looking for when pouring a rye, I can see how this would be a positive for some. For those who are looking to dip their toes into the world of ryes, this is a nice transition. Youâll start to be exposed to slight rye spice while also sticking with a sweeter profile that may be attractive to some.","Considering that Bourbon N Rye is a sourced, albeit young rye, its nearly $40 price is right at what you would expect it to be. Itâs in the range that Willett initially priced their two year rye when it first came out. Granted Willett made their rye in-house versus sourcing it, but with rising prices all around, itâs about as near apples to apples as you can get. One wonât feel they got ripped off paying its asking price, but they also wonât be getting a hidden gem in terms of price to flavor profile either.",Fall 2017,Pinhook Bourbon N Rye
188, Straight Bourbon,Lux Row Distillers,Undisclosed Kentucky Distillery(ies),100,NAS, $20 (2019),"The nose is quite approachable due to how light it is for a 100 proof bourbon. It doesnât have much depth and is straightforward with hints of hay and corn up front, and light scents of oak, caramel, and ethanol that linger behind. While the scents arenât bad in nature, itâs certainly disappointing how little overall depth this nose delivers for a 100 proof bourbon.","The sipâs oily mouthfeel is immediately noticeable and is slightly sweet overall. While notes of oak, vanilla, light leather, wheat grain, corn oil, and white pepper are all present, theyâre largely straightforward. The palate is hard to fall in love with, but also hard to find fault with it either.","The finish starts with oak, corn, leather, and sweet vanilla. Itâs medium in length, with layered heat, pepper, and oak on the backend. The finish encapsulates what this bourbon represents; straightforward, to the point, and one that isnât bad, but wonât leave a lasting impression once you finish off your glass.","Itâs pure coincidence that Rebel Yell 100 also happens to be my 100th long form bourbon review. When I realized this fact, I pondered on it for a bit and realized that it ended up being suiting that it turned out this way. With all of the various bourbons we try here at Breaking Bourbon, sometimes itâs easy to forget that some bourbons just blend in and donât stand out from the crowd. Not all bourbons deliver a memorable drinking experience, nor are they ones that youâd readily reach for on your shelf. Rebel Yell 100 is one of those bourbons. It delivers an overall average sip, but fades from memory the moment your glass is done. In terms of unique factors, you wonât find any here.","While the Rebel Yell 100âs flavor profile wonât wow anyone, its price certainly wonât offend anyone either. For $20, you get a straightforward, sippable bourbon that you can just as easily serve neat as you can with it mixed with Coke or ginger ale. With todayâs ever increasing prices, itâs rare for a bourbon to have a price that promotes experimentation, without feeling like youâre wasting money.",,Rebel Yell 100 Bourbon
189, Straight Bourbon,Diageo/Orphan Barrel Whiskey,Bernheim,90,20 Years, $85,"Smoke, leather and oak are the easiest notes to pull out. Underneath, thereâs a simmer of cinnamon, caramel, apple cider and toasted nuts.  Much like Barterhouse, this has a wonderfully developed and interesting nose.","Lots of oak and some notes of rye. Minor hints of dried fruit, like cherries and apples and tiny (and I mean tiny) amount of chocolate can be tasted.","This medium length finish packs a flavor punch in its first half, followed by a very dry finish that lingers far too long. It tastes higher proof than it is, much more so than the other Orphan Barrel releases. Again, minor notes of rye and bitter chocolate can be tasted.","You simply donât see a lot of high aged bourbons anymore. So when you do, theyâre always so fascinating. From what many master distillers say, itâs a pretty fine line between developing a well aged bourbon with nuanced flavors and a bourbon that's over aged and over oaked. When a new high aged bourbon hits the market, tasting it is always an interesting experience.First off,  Rhetoric doesnât taste as âwatered downâ as Barterhouse did. Any positive flavor notes Barterhouse had were undone by its low proof point. Rhetoric on the other hand has a more intense oak kick and a dry finish that stays with you. If aging is done right and the oak is balanced with the other flavor notes, you can have a winner on your hands (e.g. Parkerâs 27 year, Sazerac 18, Pappy 20, Van Winkle Rye). Unfortunately, this is not the case with Rhetoric. It borders on too much oak that causes the finish to be much too dry and drum out any other flavors it may have had.","Released at a $10 premium over Barterhouse, both of these 20 year old bourbons donât quite satisfy as much as their price warrants. Iâll ask myself again what I asked  in my Barterhouse review: Did I feel I paid too much for it? Yes. Did I feel ripped off? In this case, Yes. Chasing old American whiskey has become an addiction for many. Master distillers time and time again state that bourbon reaches its âsweet spotâ around 9-10 years, yet consumers canât help themselves chasing that high age statement. Comparable to other high aged bourbons on the market, Rhetoric is priced lower than most, but the quality just isn't there. Truthfully, any one of the bourbons in our âBest $20-$40 Bourbonsâ series of articles is a better buy than this.",June 2014,Rhetoric Bourbon 20 Year
190, Straight Rye,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,100,NAS, $25 (2017),"A nice mixture of fruit and grain are immediately noticeable. Dried bananas and light peaches are mixed with hints of malty grains. It reminds me of a bowl of breakfast oatmeal in the sense that itâs a pleasing scent but one thatâs very mellow and light. Surprisingly, itâs not very spicy at all.","The peaches and dried bananas from the nose carry over, and now theyâre nicely mixed with white pepper with a dash of spice. While the pepper and spice mixture is nice, itâs far from being your typical bold spicy rye flavor profile which you see with a lot of modern day ryes. Instead itâs more on the mellow fruity end. Additionally, Rittenhouse Rye doesnât have a heavy mouthfeel however itâs also not light by any means. Itâs really nicely balanced overall.","Leather, lightly charred oak, and light peach along with pepper and a dash of classic rye spice are all noticeable. While thereâs a pleasant dash of heat up front, itâs not overly hot, and not overly spicy. Dried fruit and white pepper linger for a while on the back end of the finish.  While the finish is definitely on the shorter side and I wish it lasted longer, itâs still very enjoyable.","By virtue of there only being two mainstream BiB ryes in the market (the other being E.H. Taylor Straight Rye), Rittenhouse automatically becomes slightly unique. However, where it distinguishes itself is in the fact that this is one of the fruitier mainstream ryes on the market. While hints of rye spice try to surface in the palate and the finish, I canât think of any other nationally distributed rye that packs this much fruit in the overall flavor profile.Similar to Woodford Reserve Rye, which is another rye that has an non typical flavor profile and low rye in the mashbill, some might be surprised by what they find during their first sip. This is especially true if one bought this rye expecting to find a more typical spicier and hotter rye flavor profile found in many modern day ryes. That being said while Woodford Reserve Rye leans more towards a typical bourbon flavor profile, Rittenhouse Rye still grounds itself as a rye, just one thatâs very fruit-forward. As a result, this might be appealing to bourbon drinkers looking to begin an exploration into ryes, as it does not have the intense spice many other modern day ryes offer.","While the number of ryes in the marketplace is much smaller than the number of bourbons, the price range is similar. Coming in at $25, Rittenhouse Rye is one of the more budget-friendly ryes in the marketplace with others like Jim Beam Rye, Wild Turkey Rye, and Old Overholt coming in a few dollars cheaper. This is priced right to be either a sipper or as a great fruit-forward cocktail base. Because of this, Rittenhouse is priced perfectly for what it is. You wonât feel like you overpaid for it, even with a flavor profile leaning heavily away from your typical bold spicy rye.",Ongoing,Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond
191, Straight Rye,Sugarlands Distilling Company,Sugarlands Distilling Company,123.4 (Cask Strength),2 Years, $50 (375ml) (2017),"Alcohol heavy at first, giving the whiskey some additional air time allows the alcohol to die off, revealing powerful and inviting scents. Raisin is most prominent, with dark fruit and vanilla mingling in. Thereâs an undertone of young whiskey aroma present, which at 2 years old is to be expected. Fortunately, the other more inviting scents gently overpower it.","Rye spice pops immediately, and dominates the sip heavy-handedly. It has a nice oily mouthfeel, coating the tongue thoroughly but still revealing little beyond the spice at this point. Thereâs a bit of that young whiskey taste present as well, but to be fair, less than I expected for its age.","The finish is where this whiskey really comes to life. The rye spice pops again, but its potency tapers off quickly giving way to whole new set of flavors and a fair amount of depth. Hinted on the nose, sweet raisins pull in against the tapering spice. Thereâs also a touch of oak, some vanilla, and a hint of apple bringing balance and evidence of age to the flavor profile. The finish is long-lasting, with the flavors working in harmony with one another making it a sip you want to come back to.","Roaming Man hits a number of marks you donât always see with craft whiskey. Itâs released at cask strength. The company offers a wealth of information and transparency right on the label and within the box itâs packaged in. Most importantly, it tastes good at the 2 year mark.With so many whiskeys flooding the market, lines become blurred by brands and marketing, making it hard to distinguish one from another. Many tend to be sourced whiskeys, and some are even aged using ârapid agingâ techniques like TerrePURE. Craft whiskeys distilled by the company producing them are not necessarily uncommon either, as seen by the growing number of upstart distillers in America. What is uncommon is for a craft distillery to produce a quality aged spirit within the first few bottlings, and that is a feat to be proud of. Sugarlands has accomplished that here, and Iâm excited for what else they have in store.","At $50 for a 375ml, itâs certainly not cheap. But the value discussion goes a little deeper with this release because the purchase price gets you more than just a bottle, adding in an experience and unusual amount of detail about the whiskey to go with it.This is the second batch of Roaming Man, and there were only 250 bottles released. It was offered online via pre-sale, and sold out within 48 hours. Purchasers are required to pick up their bottles from Sugarlandsâ Gatlinburg distillery. Upon picking up, they also receive a private, behind the scenes tour of the Sugarlandsâ Still House and Barrel House, a tasting of Roaming Man with a manager, and a presentation on the different flavors and aspects of Sugarlandsâ whiskey.Releasing this rye at cask strength was a smart move, but also a risky one. Itâs something I feel like I donât come across too often with craft whiskeys. At such a high proof, the ethanol can overpower the experience, especially for younger, rougher, less developed whiskeys. Fortunately in this case, the higher proof allows the flavors to shine and brings with it a more satisfying experience. If you prefer a lower proof all you need to do is add some water and youâll not only get the proof where you like it, youâll multiply the volume of whiskey to sip beyond its 375ml packaging.While this whiskey is not a $100/750ml quality whiskey by comparison to many of Kentuckyâs majors, the good news is being bottled in the smaller 375ml volume means you only need to shell out $50 to claim rights to a bottle of your own. Considering the impressive development of flavor for its young age, the limited nature of the release, the experience provided with purchase, and the overall transparency offered by the company, this is one young craft whiskey worthy of its asking price.",July 2017,Roaming Man Straight Rye Cask Strength
192, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,102.2,15 Years, $250 (2016),"A playful marriage of sweet, spice, and oak with just the right amount of intensity. The oak can smell heavy handed at first but is actually delicately tamed by hints of vanilla and caramel, and topped off with a cherry pop. Nutmeg spice wavers throughout and gives off a slight cinnamon potpourri scent. A swirl of the glass allows the bourbon to give off an additional layer of intensity and further solidifies that this is a well crafted nose.","The sweetness continues with dark fruits, cherry, and vanilla bean, all of which are brilliantly offset by layers of seasoned oak and fresh wood. This keeps the sweetness from running unchecked as the flavors remain playful and never go overboard in one direction. The palateâs flavors contain a richness that's hard to get enough of and instantly communicates that this is not an average bourbon, but one that has been expertly matured.","The intensity of the palateâs flavors peak at the start of the finish, filling my throat and nose with warmth, as they begin to fade gracefully during the long finish. The oak notes maintain a consistency throughout and are ultimately the last flavors to trail off. Itâs a enjoyable oak-forward finish with just the right intensity of flavors and warmth to produce a top-notch conclusion.","Itâs common nowadays to speak about Wild Turkeyâs slipping quality of their releases, specifically their special releases, over the better part of this decade. Itâs a topic that dominates most Wild Turkey discussions and how could it not? Itâs an odd anomaly when a special release (especially from one of Kentuckyâs majors) sits on the shelves well outside its release window possibly because of a perceived dip in quality. Has there been a real dip in quality of the companyâs output or is nostalgia getting the better part of many long time bourbon drinkers?To shed some light on this idea and to try and to put Russellâs Reserve 1998 into some context, I drank it side by side with an early 1990âs gold foil Wild Turkey 101 12 Year and a 2015 bottle of Wild Turkey 101.Both the 1990 and 1998 bottles contained the flavor richness and cherry forwardness that is common with older Wild Turkey bourbons and is what people probably remember most about them. The 1998 with three extra years of aging actually did a better job balancing its fruit notes and provided extra layers of depth. Itâs finish was also much more oak-forward and long lasting. The 1990 and 2015 bottles had a lot of basic flavor characteristics in common and both were extremely easy to drink thanks to their sweet flavors, but the 1990 had an additional flavor intensity that is absent from the 2015 bottle.Itâs hard to pull any absolutes from this comparison since weâll never know for sure how nurtured the 1990 bottle was, and the 2015 bottle doesnât have an age statement and is probably a lot younger than the other two. A simple takeaway is Russellâs Reserve 1998 is the best of the bunch in every category. Despite multiple years of less-than-amazing releases, Russellâs Reserve 1998 is a true testament of how great Wild Turkey bourbon can still be.","Russellâs Reserve 1998 is part of a growing wave of premium priced bourbon that dares to break the $200 barrier that a few short years ago, seemed almost unreachable. In this new wallet-breaking category, bourbon lovers need to reevaluate what constitutes a good value. Bourbon drinkers can fight it as much as they want, but this new premium market isnât going anywhere and is in fact growing each year.The real question of value always starts with: Can you personally afford it or not? This is especially true in this price range. Companies that have the audacity to charge an exorbitant amount, are banking on the assumption that they have an exceptional product that can justify the price and weather any potential backlash. With Russellâs Reserve 1998 arguably being one of the best and rarest releases of 2015, is that enough to justify its $250 price point? You can personally accept the growing premium bourbon market or not, but it doesnât change the fact that Russellâs Reserve 1998 is an exceptional bourbon and a higher price is therefore expected. At $250, youâre certainly not getting a deal no matter how amazing the bourbon is, but based on its exceptional quality, letâs just say, youâre not getting ripped off. Until the dust settles and a better understanding of this new pricing category is made, Russellâs Reserve 1998 joins a small group of pioneer bourbons in uncharted pricing territory. Despite its price, itâs also one thatâs quality wonât be second guessed.",August 2015,Russell's Reserve 1998 Bourbon
193, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,114.6,15 Years, $250 (2016),"Rich with honeyed oak, caramel, and vanilla forming the foundation. Seasoned wood and a splash of rye spice add dimension. 2002âs age is evident here, as the oak notes create the backbone, though itâs not overdone. The aromas are full in intensity, stripping away any dose of ethanol you might anticipate for the proof and making for a balanced and complex array of scents.","A pop of rye spice up front is followed by sweet notes of honey, caramel, and vanilla. Wood forms the base, with varying aspects of flavor - burnt wood, seasoned oak, and cigar box. Hints of leather and tobacco are also present. Notably, the rye spice up front carries through. While the flavors are a bit ad hoc, their overall complexity and depth make up for it. This results in a bold, interesting sip thatâs punchy in its delivery of flavors, but also characteristically Wild Turkey.","Rye spice carries through, along with bouts of cinnamon spice. The sweeter caramel, honey, and vanilla notes also push into the finish, accompanied by an underlying array of oak. Spicy and long, the finish turns slightly dry towards the end. While it offers less complexity than the palate, itâs well executed overall.","Russellâs Reserve 2002 follows the trend started in 2016 with Russellâs Reserve 1998 - the barrel and resulting bottle count is very low. While 3,640 to 1998âs 2,070 is technically an increase, few would argue itâs a big enough increase to dramatically change their ability to locate a bottle. As a result, itâs limited in the same sense that 1998 was because the company chose to produce only so much of it, and that production number means it wonât be readily available.Compared side by side with 1998, I wasnât surprised by what I found. At 102.2 proof, 1998 is less punchy, but more refined. 2002 is more bold, spicy, and noticeably less balanced than 1998. But its big, complex flavor profile makes up for it. Overall theyâre two bourbons that are equivalent in quality, but contrasting in how they deliver.The fact that 2002 was released non-chill filtered and at barrel proof helps to maximize the flavorsâ potential. However, these stats are not worlds away from the standard Russellâs Reserve Single Barrel release which is also non-chill filtered, bottled at 110 proof, and typically aged around 9 years.Comparing 2002 to a bottle of Russellâs Reserve Single Barrel, I found 2002 edged out the Single Barrel in every way. Not surprisingly, the most notable difference is the additional complexity and maturity found in 2002, as compared with a more dominating spice found in Single Barrel.While the comparison might seem academic, sadly I canât say I always prefer the companyâs limited releases to their standard releases. This is especially notable as I find Wild Turkeyâs standard releases to be a high quality and some of my favorites. Diamond Anniversary and Masterâs Keep 17 Year are examples of releases that were lacking in comparison. Fortunately, 2002 offers enough of a gain in every sense to say with conviction that itâs a better bourbon than anything Wild Turkey puts out on a regular basis.","When a limited release from a major distillery has such a small number, 3,640 bottles in this case, the value analysis has multiple, often conflicting, angles of approach. Russellâs Reserve 1998 also set a precedent at $250, and considering 2002 is not far off in terms of overall quality, retail price, and overall low bottle count, the same reaction from consumers can be expected. The bourbon inside the bottle is safely a notch or two above the readily available Russellâs Reserve Single Barrel, which clocks in around $50. To me, this is a win for Wild Turkey and reasonable at $250 given todayâs market, but beyond that a higher consideration of value is certainly driven by other motivating factors or a âhave-to-have-itâ kind of attitude.",July 2018,Russell's Reserve 2002
194, Straight Rye,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,90,18 Years, $70,"Much less spicy than would be expected for a rye. Dry and sweet, with an amazing balance. Just like the nose there is little if any burn here. Vanilla, maple, and citrus lightly mingle together, with no single element overpowering another. Smokey wood enters towards the end but does not overpower the other flavors as you might anticipate from 18 long years in a barrel. Maybe itâs the age or maybe itâs just low on rye in the mashbill, either way this does not have that kick you get with most ryes.","One of the longest and most complex finishes of any whiskey Iâve had. Outstanding. It ends as amazingly as it starts, as perfectly balanced wood, fruit, and spice linger for minutes after the sip. It fades away elegantly maintaining balance even as the flavors dissipate over time. Wood is more evident here than the nose or palate, but it is still perfectly balanced.","The Sazerac 18 has a fairly interesting background. It is, of course, part of the highly anticipated Buffalo Trace Antique Collection annual release. From our calculations (see our 2013 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection Fact Sheet for some interesting factoids), approximately 4,360 bottles were released in 2013. Thatâs less than 90 bottles per state before you account for if and how much might be allocated outside of the United States. Even more interesting is that this was put into barrels back in 1985. So itâs really 28 years old if you want to get technical about it. However, it was removed from the barrels in 2003 and put into stainless steel tanks to prevent further aging. Since then, Buffalo Trace has been drawing down from this supply while waiting for more to come of age. I donât know when the last of this stainless steel supply will be, but I am eagerly awaiting the release poured fresh from the barrel to compare the two. There is quite a bit of debate as to how much impact the stainless steel may or may not have on the flavor, but I can imagine there will be some notable differences once we put some of this old juice side by side with whatever comes directly out of the currently aging barrels.","Iâm going to be clear in this - if you appreciate a balanced whiskey then buy it if you see it, you may not have another opportunity. There are few that contend with the near perfect balance attained by this one.","I have to be honest on this, I did not fully appreciate this the first time I had it ( sampling a previous release from a friendâs collection alongside of some other whiskeys). Being bombarded with barrel proof bottles at the time, I was expecting full on blasts of flavor from everything I was trying and not appreciating anything else. After that brief spell wore off something amazing happened: I grew up...at least as a whiskey drinker (my wife would probably tell you otherwise in any other regard). I was fortunate to find a bottle of the 2013 release and actually spend some time with it. Now, I look forward to each pour just so I can dig deeper into its complexity. If youâre relatively new to whiskey, be sure to drink this sparingly. Save the lot of it for when youâve been able to try a good variety and can begin to appreciate balance and complexity as much as in-your-face flavor. Those who may have sampled only a few whiskeys before this one may not find this all that exciting, so keep that in mind if you happen to find any.",Fall 2013,Sazerac 18 Year Rye 2013 Release
195, Straight Rye,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,90,18 Years, $80 (2014),"The first words to escape my lips when bringing the glass up to my nose were âOh God.â The sweet aroma that this whiskey gives off is amazing. Soft subtle traces of vanilla, honey, soft grain and light wood waft out of the glass. I canât emphasize enough how sweetly soft and subtle these aromas are for an aged rye. Unlike the majority of  the BTAC collection, Sazerac is bottled at a very manageable 90 proof, which gives it zero alcohol burn on the nose. Every time I smelled this whiskey I was transported to the early morning hours of a rickhouse in Kentucky, right after the doors are opened and the soft scent of whiskey fills your nose. Truly perfection.","When taking a sip, youâre instantly reminded that this is an aged rye youâre drinking. Flavors of subtle vanilla and light citrus mix with dry flavors of rye, aged oak, and soft leather. While wood is definitely present, Iâm surprised that itâs not at the forefront and doesnât dominate the palate like you would expect in an 18 year old rye. Yes, itâs dry and not as sweet as the nose would lead you to believe, but itâs also not spicy like you would expect from a rye. Truly just all flavor with zero alcohol present.","The finish on the Sazerac 18 Year seems to last forever. Much like the nose and palate, the finish is very subtle and understated. I tasted light traces of honey, orange, and peach bubblegum, mixed elegantly with subtle hints of soft rye and lightly toasted wood. This may sound like a strange pairing of flavors, however theyâre truly elegant together and bring one of the most enjoyable finishes Iâve had in a long time.","The last great rye I tasted that was this good was, drum roll pleaseâ¦.BTAC 2013 Sazerac. Seeing as how the BTAC Sazerac line was removed from the barrels in 2003 and put into stainless steel tanks to prevent further aging, this makes sense. Since then, Buffalo Trace has been drawing down from this supply while waiting for more to come of age.  So, youâre drinking a near identical whiskey year over year since it was tanked.High aged ryes are rare and those that arenât overly woody are even rarer. While the Van Winkle Rye is almost equally as delicious, itâs only aged 13 years vs the Sazeracâs 18. To be able to age in the barrel for another 5 years and still equally compete with a perfectly aged 13 year rye is pretty special in my book. Iâm really looking forward to seeing what the next iteration of Sazerac tastes like after Buffalo Trace finishes off the current batch from the steel tanks. While I have high hopes that BT can match what theyâre currently bottling, theyâve set the standards pretty high for themselves to equal the last 11 year run of Sazerac.","Youâre hard pressed to find another rye, let alone another bourbon that will be better than Sazerac for the price. This could easily command double the price tag for a bottle and still be considered a good value due to the well balanced rye Buffalo Trace has put together. While it may be hard to find in the stores, Iâd highly recommend buying a bottle if you ever get the opportunity. I'd even recommend shelling out more than you normally would for a glass of this at your favorite bourbon bar.",Fall 2014,Sazerac 18 Year Rye 2014 Release
196, A Blend of Straight Bourbon,Smooth Ambler,Sourced  & MGP,100,NAS (Blend of 2 year & 9 year bourbons), $55 (2016),"The older rye based bourbon does a nice job of covering up the contents of the younger wheated bourbon as the nose offers little hint that young distillate is present. Instead, hints of sweet wheat, rye spice, baking spices, green apples, dried fruit, and young wood are present. Additionally, very little alcohol is present. The nose is pleasant, yet I was hoping to experience something a little more complex considering this is a four grain bourbon.","The youthful wheat component of the bourbon pops out on first sip. New oak, corn, bubble gum, hints of dark chocolate, and slight amounts of vanilla and honey are present along with a healthy dose of rye spice. Less sweet than the nose and much spicier, the flavor combination seems like it would work great, but in reality the palate comes across as nothing more than ho-hum. I was really hoping there would be more interplay between the older rye and the more youthful wheat seeing as they were left to meld for an additional three months in the barrels. Even though the young wheated component makes up just 27% of the overall blend, this component makes a more pronounced impact, while the rye just seems to bring an enhanced spice level.","Spicy upfront and dry in the back, the finish tastes like twist on a version of your typical MGP rye based bourbon. Heavy rye spice, charred oak, and light vanilla all make an immediate appearance. This is followed by leather and a lot of aged oak to cap it off. The finish lingers for too long and overstays itâs welcome, as it feels like I am chewing on a toothpick after a while. If you like really woody, dry finishes then this is for you. The finish is the opposite of the palate in the sense that the younger wheated bourbon seemingly has no impact here.","A blended bourbon containing a total of four grains spread out between a young wheated bourbon and a mature rye bourbon is definitely not something that comes along every day. Kudos to Smooth Ambler for giving this a go and bringing something unique to the market. I wish more distilleries and non distiller producers would take chances with four grain blends like this one.The interesting part of this bourbon is that even though the blend had time to meld together over the three months it spent in the barrels, I really donât feel the end result pushes the envelope. Instead of a harmony of flavors, this still tastes like two distinct separate bourbons at different times. Itâs really not bad, however that being said, the flavor profile itself isnât all that memorable either.","At $55 this is a high cost to pay for the final product. While I didnât walk away disappointed, I keep coming back to the fact that for the same price, I have tasted far better blends. In fact, both Highwest Double Ryewhich consists of a young whiskey blended with an old whiskey and Son of Bourye which consists of younger blended bourbon and rye are superior products for a reasonable price. I also find it ironic that you can pick up a bottle of Smooth Amblerâs Old Scout 7 year for less and experience a more refined tasting experience.",Ongoing,Smooth Ambler Contradiction
197, Straight Bourbon,Smooth Ambler,Sourced from MGP in Indiana,99,7 Year, $39 (2016),"Caramel, vanilla, and pipe tobacco pull through a thin layer of alcohol. The scents are subtle and not particularly inviting.","Chewy pipe tobacco and burnt wood are rounded out by chocolate and a hint of cherry fruit. Thereâs a nice, distinctive earthy quality that really comes forward in the sip, and I just canât help thinking how well this might pair with a cigar.","A bit of spice pops right away along with an astringency thatâs a little out of place. This fades quickly and leaves you with the chocolatey, earthy, burnt wood flavors from the palate. Oddly it starts bad and ends good, leaving some really nice flavors behind.","John Little and Tag Galyean established Smooth Ambler in 2009. Like David Perkins did with High West, they decided to source some of their whiskey so they could offer some reasonably aged bottlings along with in-house distilled offerings. Not surprisingly, these are sourced from MGP in Indiana. MGP distills a good deal of what we see on the shelves under many names, however the end product is always a little different. In this case we donât really have anything unique on paper, but what we do have is a flavor profile that has an earthy quality I just donât come across that often. Lucky for us, the folks at Smooth Ambler certainly know how to select barrels with a nice flavor profile.","At $39 this is not priced to fly off the shelves, but itâs not greedy either. Smooth Ambler is a newer company and could have easily marketed this as a craft bourbon for $60 or more. Fortunately they didnât, and their pricing is spot on as a result. Moreover, the pricing combined with their honesty of the bourbonâs origin has earned them my trust.",Discontinued,Smooth Ambler Old Scout 7 Year Bourbon
198, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,134.4 (Batch 1),NAS (BT has stated 7 years), $55 (2017),"I let this sit in the glass for about 10 minutes before nosing it. Even then my nostrils fill with alcohol. Raisins, citrus, chocolate, and caramel also manage to pull through. This is expected for the proof but itâs not a warming burn like Knob Creek Single Barrel. Itâs more of a deterrent for me.","Very hot. Traces of raisins and citrus mingle throughout, but are muted by the sharpness of the heat. If you read my review on High West Double Rye, I talk about spice without heat. This is the exact opposite, itâs heat without spice. I donât care for it to this extreme and it makes for a fairly unpleasant and unbalanced sip.","A sharp dose of pepper dominates the initial burn, almost like biting into a peppercorn accidentally. After this spike the heat lingers for a bit. Ironically, the burn is kind of nice once you get past the initial sting, making for a long lasting sweet finish rounded out with elements of burnt brown sugar, caramel, and dark chocolate.","Although the barrel proof options are growing, there are still a limited number of options out there. Consumers are demanding higher proof offerings and weâre seeing those move fairly quickly off the shelves. This is a limited batch release, meaning that Buffalo Trace has been releasing this in fairly small batches 3-4 times annually at varying proofs as enough bourbon meets the desired flavor profile. Itâs deliberately inferior to George T. Stagg, as this is necessary to maintain the status of that annually released product as a top notch and sought after bourbon, with Stagg Jr being a prelude to what is to come only once a year. Elijah Craig is also doing this with their barrel proofoffering, and we have seen that move very quickly from the liquor store shelves as well. The flavor profile of Stagg Jr may not be to my liking, but it is unique none-the-less. From other opinions Iâve read that the releases vary in quality and they seem to be getting better as time progresses. Bourbon enthusiasts will need to try this themselves in order to make their own determination. For me, itâs uniqueness of flavor is the best thing Stagg Jr has going for it.","Despite the fact that I find this overly hot, not everyone shares this opinion. Iâve even heard people say they like it better than the original George T. Stagg. Based on this and the fact that itâs around 8-9 years old (or 7 years based on recent BT comments) and released at barrel proof, an MSRP of $50 is really a fair deal. If this were more balanced I would rate it higher, but the fact remains that Buffalo Trace still has some work to do in choosing the barrels to batch together for this younger release in order to gain mass appeal and uphold an ongoing market. Now that the newness has worn off, weâll see if enough people like this to continue sales at the same rate theyâve been so far.",Fall 2013 / Ongoing,Stagg Jr Bourbon
199, Whiskey,Proximo Spirits,Stanahan's,94,4 Years, $70 (2017),"Mellow on the nose, which I found to be different than your typical American whiskey. Diamond Peak brings warm subtle scents to the table; hints of warm banana bread, cinnamon, spiced apples, and walnuts are present but very subtle. Additionally Iâm picking up a hint of creamed corn, which I also found to be present in the standard version of Stranahanâs, however much lighter in the Diamond Peak version. This is slightly odd, since this is the equivalent of a 4 year malted scotch made with no corn.","The palate is sweet and light. Apple and oak are the first flavors to immediately pop out the moment I take a sip. Behind them I get hints of vanilla, honey, light toffee, and dried fruit. Itâs a really nice flavor profile and one that quickly coats your whole mouth. Youâll want to hold this one in for just a few extra seconds before swallowing to make sure you notice all the subtle flavors the palate contains.","The finish brings a nice mix of heat and light flavors. An initial coating of warmth fills your mouth along with mixed dried fruit and dried apple slices. Itâs a lighter flavor profile than preferred, but one that is still enjoyable.","I find the standard version of Stranahanâs to be a really unique product. Itâs one of the few American single malts on the market and it offers a unique, bold flavor profile that you donât find in any other bourbons or ryes in the market. I was hoping that Diamond Peak would improve on this uniqueness, however I walked away slightly disappointed. While Iâd say itâs unique in its own right due to the limited batch runs the distillery is releasing, when compared directly to its sibling, Diamond Peak doesnât seem quite that unique anymore. The in-your-face bold flavor profile of the standard Stranahanâs is gone, instead replaced with a much mellower, warmer flavor profile that doesnât distinguish itself from other similarly aged bourbons and whiskeys as much.","I find the standard version of Stranahanâs to just be an average value for consumers. While in line with other craft distillery pricing, Stranahanâs still commands a price that I feel might be too high for some. With the standard Stranahanâs youâre getting a really unique whiskey experience that you normally donât get with other craft products, however for $55 youâre also competing with some really great bourbons and ryes on the market. On top of that there remains a lot of talk around variation between batches which is somewhat concerning when taking the plunge to buy a bottle.Diamond Peak comes in at $15 over the price of the standard version, which is a pretty steep increase. Sure you get to taste a pure 4 year old version of Stranahanâs, however I donât feel the flavor profile backs up the price in this case. At $70 it falls in a weird middle-ground pricing wise, sitting a little higher than the standard version while much less than their bi-annual exclusive Snowflake release. With both the standard and Snowflake releases, youâre getting over-the-top unique flavor profiles. With Diamond Peak, youâre getting a much more mellow profile, that while pleasant, is overpriced for what it is.",April 2015 / Ongoing,Stanahan's Diamond Peak
200, Whiskey,Proximo Spirits,Stranahan's,94,NAS (Website states 2-5 years), $55 (2017),"The nose on Stranahanâs is different than your typical American whiskey, and for good reason. Theyâve basically produced the equivalent of a malted scotch in Colorado. Iâm greeted with a blast of sickly sweet scents of vanilla, fresh marshmallows, and apple butter along with oats and, oddly enough, a hint of creamed corn. There is a complete absence of  alcohol burn on the nose.To me this is a great unique scent profile that you just donât find when drinking other American whiskeys. I will say that the nose may not appeal to everyone, especially those who are used to drinking bourbon or rye. That being said, I kept going back to smell this throughout the tasting and really enjoyed the uniqueness it brings to the table.","This is a really interesting palate. Oak is very noticeable along with light barley and oats. A little deeper is vanilla, mixed dried fruit, and a touch of honey and dried nuts. Itâs certainly an interesting full flavor combination and one youâll want to linger on. When an individual is starting to really get into whiskey, and a whiskey is described to them as having a really good mouthfeel, itâs sometimes hard to understand what that means. If youâre in this situation, then I really recommend you try a glass of Stranahanâs neat, as this whiskey has a fantastic mouthfeel. Rich and full, the flavors coat your tongue and this whiskey sits heavy in your mouth.","A sharp dose of pepper dominates the initial burn, almost like biting into a peppercorn accidentally. After this spike the heat lingers for a bit. Ironically, the burn is kind of nice once you get past the initial sting, making for a long lasting sweet finish rounded out with elements of burnt brown sugar, caramel, and dark chocolate.","When compared to other American whiskeys, this is one of the more unique ones. There are few other craft distillers out there who are making as big a waves as Stranahanâs has been over the years. While others such as Balcones and Ranger Creek also make 100% barely whiskeys, they also compete in the bourbon and rye space too. With bourbon and rye being on fire these last few years, you have to give Stranahanâs credit for taking a more unique approach to whiskey making and sticking with just 100% barley whiskey as their only product on the market. Sure they have their Diamond Peak and Snowflake releases, but those are just variations on the aging and barreling of their core 100% barley product. The end result could have been disastrous, however itâs pulled off quite nicely here.","The problem with craft distilled products is that distilleries try to command a price that isnât in line with current well established whiskey products in the market. While in line with other craft distillery pricing, Stranahanâs still commands a price that I feel might be too high for some. True youâre getting a really unique whiskey experience, that you normally donât get with other craft products, however for $55 youâre competing with some really great bourbons and ryes in the market. I would prefer to see the price come in at $45 to make it more accessible to those looking to add some variety to their collections.For something this unique I would recommend that people try it at a bar before they buy a bottle. Youâll either really be into something this different, or it wonât be your cup of tea and youâll have saved yourself $55 plus dollars on a bottle.",Ongoing,Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey
201, Straight Bourbon,Firestone & Robertson Distilling Company,Firestone & Robertson Distilling Company,90,NAS, $50 (2019),"A blast of corn dominates upfront. A nice balance of fresh pecan pie, maple sugar candy, vanilla, banana, and a hint of oak follow. The nose conveys a hint of youth, but not in a negative way. This is a well balanced nose and a good start to the sip.","Soft and sweet - baking spices and pecan pie are noticeable at first, followed by brown butter and light vanilla. These are joined by a dash of peppery spice. While the spice adds an interesting presence, it seems to slightly throw off the great dynamic that the sweeter flavors develop. For such a mix of flavors I was also surprised at the lighter mouthfeel, and  when combined with the unbalanced pepper, holds this above average sip from going to the next level.","An ever-so-slight dash of sweetness kicks of the finish, however itâs replaced almost instantly by a peppery and oak mixture, which dominates the rest of the time. This flavor combination clings to your mouth for an extremely long time. While the length is a pleasant surprise, its one dimensional finish ends this bourbon on a downward note compared to how the sip started.","TX Bourbon is certainly different - both in how itâs created and the resulting flavor profile. While there is no legal definition of what it means to be defined as a Texas Bourbon, TX embodies the Texas spirit through and through by sourcing all the ingredients for the mashbill from Texas. This includes doing research on what yeast strain would work best for their needs, and then according to Firestone & Robertson, finding the yeast on a single Texas pecan nut of all places. Romantic backstory of the yeast aside, at the end of the day this dedication to trying new things is what can make craft distilling so unique and refreshing. On the flavor side, these locally sourced ingredients come together in a great way that feels totally new compared to other whiskeys in the marketplace. Donât equate that statement to mean itâs a slam dunk bourbon, because itâs not. Yet its flavor profile feels fresh and enjoyable and shows that Firestone & Robertson have the potential to turn this into a highly regarded bourbon one day.","The value of this bourbon can be compared two different ways. Priced at $50, itâs in line, if not slightly less than what many craft distillers charge for their product. And in many cases, the craft product is younger and less developed. When compared to more mainstream distillers though, the $50 is high for what the product actually is, a younger bourbon with a unique, yet average flavor profile. Price is always a subjective value, but in this case it feels like TX Bourbon is priced right for what it is.",,TX Texas Straight Bourbon
202, Whiskey,Diageo/Orphan Barrel Distilling Co.,Sourced from MGP and Bernheim Distillery,115,Blend of 4 year old bourbon & corn whiskey along with a 17 year old bourbon, $50 (2015),"Easily summed up as sweet, mild, and leaning on the basic side of the scale. Notes of vanilla, sweet corn, citrus, and a bit of dark fruit are wrapped up with a caramel bow. Thereâs a bit of youth on the nose that is well balanced by a faint hint of age from oak undertones. Far from heavy or overpowering, these oak influencers provide a nice foundation to an otherwise wobbly structure. Pleasant smelling, but run-of-the-mill.","Strong oak upfront with vanilla following in tow. A faint hint of caramel sweetness struggles to pull through the oak. Extremely basic and limited showing of flavors makes you wonder if they were even there in the first place. Its dearth of flavors and absence of memorable characteristics make this a soulless whiskey. To describe it as pure grain alcohol isnât quite fair, but its lack of depth and overall weak flavor puts it on the fringe of that classification.","Harsh is an understatement here. This finishes with the heat of a barrel proof whiskey without the additional intensity of flavors that generally comes with it. Oak is once again the dominating flavor on the finish, but I donât get the sense that itâs silencing other flavors. Like the palate, the finish lacks a noticeable range in flavor. Far on the backend is a bit of dryness that brings with it a musty aftertaste thatâs mild in intensity, but never-the-less unpleasant and unwanted. This alone doesn't ruin the finish, since it was already ruined well before this point.","Diageo is marketing Gifted Horse as an accident. The company says they never intended to mix 4 year old bourbon and corn whiskey into their 17 year old Tennessee bourbon stock. âAccidental whiskeyâ is becoming a trend within the bourbon industry over the last few years, and it makes you think these massive multi-million dollar companies are run by The Three Stooges.That said, itâs not exactly common for a major whiskey company to mix corn whiskey into aged bourbon stock, so in a way, Gifted Horse is a bit unique. In this case though, unique isnât synonymous with great. If this wasnât actually an accident, a logical conclusion why this blend exists is that Diageo had a number of not-so-great 17 year old bourbon barrels that needed to be cut with younger whiskey. Blending old with young isnât new and the end result, in theory, should produce something that mutually compensates for the otherâs flaws. Instead, the corn whiskey and aged bourbon blend together like oil and water. The harsh grain flavoring of the corn whiskey is immediately contrasted by the dry oaky traits of the 17 year old bourbon. Even the inclusion of a larger ratio of 4 year old bourbon into the mix isnât enough to round out the flavor profile, though it might have made a more positive impact if it was a little older or more mature tasting. Sure Gifted Horseâs blend is unique, but itâs also something I probably could have replicated myself with better results. With a blend this haphazard, maybe this truly was an accident.","At $50, Gifted Horse is the least Diageo has charged for an Orphan Barrel whiskey, and it's for good reason. The company probably did ample research to figure out what the market would be willing to pay for this blend of whiskeys. The thing is, if it tasted good, who ultimately cares whatâs in it? The flavor would justify its price. The problem is it doesnât. Weâve reviewed a fews sub-$20 bottom shelf whiskeys and most of them are superior to Gifted Horse. How Diageo has the audacity to charge anywhere close to $50 for this is an insult to their customers, and is probably doing more harm than good to their Orphan Barrel brand, which is already a controversial brand to begin with.",February 2016,The Gifted Horse
203, Blend of Straight Whiskeys,Diageo/T.H.L Whiskey Co.,Sourced,80,NAS, $50,"Light but also chipper thanks to a nice balance of its fruit notes. The citrusy and sweet scents are enjoyable, yet on the weak side, which is most likely due to the whiskeyâs low proof. Caramel and vanilla provide a sturdy foundation that at times overpower additional scents of gingerbread, honey, and candied dark fruits. Not overly complex, but likable enough to make you forget that it isnât.","It can be quite the whirlwind tasting experience for this light whiskey, which hides under a veil of such a low proof. The flavors donât have much weight to them yet seemingly come at you all at once, fighting for your attention. Light fruit notes are compounded with a mishmash of caramel, vanilla, toffee, clove, leather, spice, and oak that donât quite congeal into an easily understandable and refined package. None of it is bad per say, but far from a home run.","A spicy, rye-forward kick opens that ends on a oaky semi-dry finish. The transition from the beginning of the finish to the end is an enjoyable switcheroo. This blend of whiskeys creates an interesting metamorphosis of flavor on its finish, one that goes to show how interesting blends can be, yet ultimately shoots itself in its own foot with its lack of punch due to its low proof.","Blending is nothing new for whiskey, but an emerging trend of American whiskey blends from high-profile celebrities is. Itâs doubtful if these celebrities have much to do with the actual sourcing, blending, and fine tuning of their whiskeyâs flavor profile, but their clout brings an additional layer of awareness to their brand. Itâs easy to look at these new products as cash-ins on a popular spirit category or sub-par in quality since their name isnât generally associated with whiskey making, but itâs never safe to judge a book by its cover.Itâs an interesting choice for a blend to include three different types of whiskeys from three different decades. At first the whiskey does come across as having a unique taste thanks to the amount of different flavors hitting you all at once. The blend doesnât taste overly young or old, nor overly cheap or expensive. There are few peaks and valleys in its flavor profile since all of the flavors hit with the same intensity. Itâs only after tasting it a few times that this uniqueness begins to wear off along with your general interest.","Determining if a whiskey is a good value depends on what type of whiskey drinker you are. This seems to be true for this whiskey more than most. Diehards will balk at its $50 MSRP because of its 80 proof point and lack of information on its whiskeysâ origins, exact ages and percentages in the blend. Itâs feasible that collectors will gladly shell out $50 for its stylish bottle, high-profile celebrity association, and its intriguing blend of three different types of whiskeys. Casual drinkers will likely see this whiskey as an enchanting curiosity, a step up from their normal go-to whiskeys and a potential shelf trophy to their growing collection. With many limited edition, high profile and ornate-looking bottles hitting the market over the past few years, The Hilhaven Lodgeâs $50 MSRP is well within market acceptability. The price is probably going to be too high for most, mainly because of its proof, but there might be just enough going on with this blend to make some whiskey drinkers satisfied with their purchase.",April 2016 / Ongoing,The Hilhaven Lodge Whiskey
204, Rye,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,128.4,6 Years, $70 (2013),"Spicy cinnamon, caramel, and maple syrup are followed by a sweet kick with intense fruit - raisins, plums, and apricots. There is quite a bit of wonderful, flavorful punch here.",A long lingering spicy-sweetness with a hint of black licorice. Leaves me wanting to take another sip every time.,"For me this is really a great whiskey and stands somewhat on its own. As an annual release with an estimated production of 8,440 bottles this year itâs certainly limited even if it is the easiest of the Antique Collection to find. Considering whatâs on your liquor storeâs shelves, there is very little, if anything to choose from in the barrel proof rye category. Not only that, the whiskey itself is delicious with few flavor profile comparable. Although some might disagree with me, the closest that comes to mind is Blantonâs Single Barrel, with the Blantonâs tasting like an extremely watered down version of this when sipped side by side. Specifically, the fruit and raisin elements are what I find to be similar between the two, while the spice elements are all but lost with the Blantonâs.","At $70 a bottle it better be good. Itâs not just good: itâs great. Also, itâs rare. This is absolutely worth picking up if the flavor profile is to your liking and youâre lucky enough to find a bottle. Act quickly though, you wonât see this on the shelf for long.","Wow! At only 6 years old and barrel proof this bold and youthful rye packs a spicy punch, yet itâs smooth enough to drink neat. I found myself savoring every sip of this and wanting another pour once I was finished. This one doesnât hold back as the intensity and depth of flavor are anything but subtle. This is truly a remarkable whiskey, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a rich, sweet, higher proof whiskey and isnât afraid of a little spice.",Fall 2013,Thomas H. Handy 2013 Release
205, Rye,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,129.2,"6 Years, 3 Months", $80 (2014),"The moment I poured this rye into my glass, a strong burst of alcohol scent filled the air around me. This whiskey is not for the faint of heart. So, it was no surprise that a very strong dose of alcohol is upfront and present on the nose. Behind the alcohol are faint traces of citrus and dried raisins.","The 2014 Handy has a very hot flavorful palate. The heat starts the moment the whiskey hits your mouth. At first, a touch of sweet vanilla is present, which instantly transforms into leather, wood, allspice and rye spice.","The finish on this bourbon reminds you of what youâre drinking right to the end - a big, bold barrel proof rye. Hot and full of pepper, this finish lingers with you for a long time. The heat starts on the tip of your tongue and slowly envelops your whole mouth before inching its way down your throat. This by no means is a bad thing, as itâs less of a jet fuel burning sensation (e.g. Stagg Jr) and more of a spicy hot finish that makes you appreciate the uniqueness of what youâre drinking. Sitting 2-3 minutes between sips, youâre treated to subtle lingering notes of dried raisin and hay. The mixture is quite delicious and makes you want to go back for another sip just to experience the very tail end of the finish again.","In the microcosm of the BTAC collection, Thomas Handy isnât the most unique bottle per production numbers. It's actually the second highest produced after George T. Stagg. Compared to other annual whiskeys, Iâd consider this a smaller release, as Buffalo Trace still only bottled and released less than 8,500 bottles of Handy this year, making it unique from that standpoint. It may be a young rye, but it delivers a big distinct flavor profile that other whiskeys are hard-pressed to replicate.Furthermore, few companies are actively distilling and releasing their own barrel proof aged ryes. Sure you could find aged Willetts as old as or older than the Handy line, but, none deliver the year-over-year consistency that youâre able to find with this whiskey.","In a world full of ever-rising whiskey costs, Buffalo Trace continues to offer their Antique Collection at a reasonable price. While the $80 MSRP is $10 more than last year, youâre getting access to the best honey barrels available at the distillery, bottled at barrel proof, and unfiltered. Youâre not going to get a better opportunity to taste what the Master Distiller is tasting than with this release of Thomas Handy. A very solid value indeed for a barrel proof uncut / unfiltered rye.",Fall 2014,Thomas H. Handy 2014 Release
206, Straight Bourbon (finished with Oregon Oak Staves),Hood River Distillers,Undisclosed distillery in Kentucky,90,8 Years, $40 (2018),"Light and inviting. Raisins, honey, and a trace of fresh wood characterize the aroma. Its 90 proof is evident here, as the scents are relaxed and mild, making for a pleasant, albeit subtle, experience.","A burst of flavor thatâs immensely enjoyable yet not overpowering. Vanilla bean, maple syrup, cotton candy, apple, and a touch of anise make up the sweeter notes. Nutmeg and fresh oak balance them out, bringing a touch of spice and trace of wood into the mix. The mouthfeel is satisfying, and well above average considering the proof.","Light spice pops at first, followed by traces of the sweeter elements on the palate. The sweet turns to dry, giving way to a subtle yet lengthy finish. Overall the sip is delicate and notably well balanced.","In 2016 I included Rebel Yell Single Barrel in my favorite whiskeys of the year. A 100 proof 10 year old sourced wheated bourbon originating from Kentucky, it was most likely distilled by Heaven Hill. At $50 (for the first release), it wowed me with its overall quality at an (almost) everymanâs price.Trailâs End Batch 003 is very reminiscent of Rebel Yell Single Barrel. It echoes the same level of craftsmanship, and side by side itâs even more apparent theyâre within the same range of quality and drinkability. As opposed to bombastic flavor or a funky finish, Trailâs End instead offers balance - a quality many strive for, but few are able to achieve.The company attributes this balance to the medium toasted Oregon Oak stave finishing - a process much like Makerâs Mark uses to createMakerâs 46. This finishing is said to soften the wood notes allowing other flavors to shine through. While the exact length of time the staves are used for finishing varies, the company states that batch consistency and achieving the desired flavor profile are the driving factors in determining how long the bourbon is finished. Regardless of how the bourbon begins, finishing with barrel staves is something few are doing, and the end result is certainly a good one.","The technicals place Trailâs End in a bit of a pinch when it comes to pricing. At 8 years old and 90 proof it will be approached with a price expectation. Being sourced from Kentucky helps with perception (there seem to be far fewer whiskeys sourced from Kentucky distilleries than Indiana distilleries nowadays), as does its high end packaging. The additional Oregon Oak stave finishing adds an element of value that cannot be ignored, a step that takes time and money to accomplish. But in the end, itâs the flavor profile that will win fans over. As a result, $40 feels like a really good deal in todayâs frenzied marketplace.",2018,Trailâs End Bourbon Batch 003
207, Straight Rye,Sazerac Company Inc.,Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery / Buffalo Trace,95.6,13 Years, $65 (2014),"Vanilla, caramel, and fresh wood. Easy to sniff. Smells more like bourbon than rye.","The rye comes forward immediately, but then it fades back to bourbon-like elements evidenced on the nose. Youthful rye spice, cinnamon, and black pepper followed by caramel, vanilla, burnt brown sugar, and fresh wood. Other flavors are evident (in a good way), theyâre just difficult to pinpoint.",A sweetness creeps up and lingers for a bit. Medium length. Leaves a nice aftertaste and entices you to go back for more.,"Iâm fortunate to have experienced a good number of ryes. There are a limited number of total options and even fewer on any given day at any given liquor store. The Van Winkle Family Reserve is one of the best ryes money can buy, if you can find it that is. It has high corn in the mashbill compared with other ryes, but the sweetness is not overpowering. There are other good choices of course. Willett produces quality ryes based on hand selecting the barrels and then bottling them, typically at a much younger age - these are very good when you can find them. Thomas H. Handy and Sazerac 18 are released once a year as part of the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, each is excellent but in a way that contrasts with the other. Handy is heavy-weight flavor punch while Saz 18 is delicate and balanced. High West has produced a number of high quality ryes which also contrast but complement one another nicely. There are numerous others I could list but the point is this - the Van Winkle has something different. Ryes reach maturity at a young age, typically 6-8 years but even less in some cases. Adding age should add interest and complexity, and the Van Winkle is the epitome of quality aging. 13 years in a barrel, perfect balance, wood and rye elements, a rich and full textureâ¦ itâs really something special. Iâll talk about an âX-factorâ sometimes in my reviews. Itâs that element you canât really explain but you know itâs there. Itâs just awesome for some hard-to-describe reason. This has that.","If you see it buy it. This may be the hardest of the Van Winkle lineup to locate and sees lowest production of the bunch. Itâs a bargain for anything less than $75, and still worth considering upwards of $150. I know this sells for up to $600 in the aftermarket, but that has no bearing on my value rating in this review. It is great stuff. Itâs really hard to find, and itâs something you wonât regret purchasing.

208, Rye,Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (KBD),Willett Distillery (Sourced),94,23 Years, $90,"Tobacco, burnt wood, rich vanilla, and caramel. Robust and fairly complex.","Buries you with wood flavors - old wood, tobacco, cigar box, burnt caramel, and vanilla.","A mix of bitter old wood, dark chocolate, leather, and the tail end of a cigar. Lengthy, but hard to tell if itâs incredibly complex or just weird. The longer you sit thinking about it, the worse it seems to get.","Heavy on wood, super high age for a rye, difficult to find, secret backstory. This creates a recipe for a unique pour and some interesting discussions along the way. I hate to give credit to a secret backstory, but you have to wonder where this 23 year old was born and raised. Itâs got a few younger siblings as well - 17 and 21 year-olds. I havenât had the opportunity to taste them, but it seems as if the 23 year version is about as heavy on wood as anyone might like.","This isnât something youâre going to want to drink every day, but rather an occasional pour with others who just want to experience it. We purchased ours directly from a liquor store for $90. Would I pay $90 if this was always available? Never. The Buffalo Trace Antique Collection blows this out of the water, so itâs arguably not even worth $70 a bottle. However, we donât live in a bubble. The value lies in the fact that itâs difficult or impossible to find and sports a super high age and an interesting flavor profile. These additional facts could arguably make it priced right at $90 a bottle.",2008 (Estimated),Vintage Rye 23 Year
209, Straight Bourbon,"Sazerac Company, Inc.",Buffalo Trace,90,12 Years, $30 (2016),"It tastes very close to how it smells. All of the nuanced aromas of the nose also develop similarly on your tongue. It has a sweetness to it, yet never goes overboard as you think it might. Thereâs also a subtle amount of dryness arrives midway. The palate isnât quite equal to the layered texture of the nose but it comes close.","It finishes with some spicy hotness but again, never goes overboard. The wheatâs sweetness is still present, but the finish is better characterized by its equal amount of dryness. Itâs a nice balance between the two. Flavor wise, the caramel and vanilla are still present along with more oak. The medium in length finish is also medium in weight.","Weller 12 Year might the closest you can get to tasting Pappy Van Winkle. It comes from the same recipe as Van Winkle Lot B, which is also aged 12 years, but doesn't get the sweetest spots in the warehouses. For many people thatâs enough to convince them to buy it. Itâs also one of the few wheated bourbon on the market which put it into a category with few competitors. Of those competitors, 90% of them are from the same brand line. On top of that, itâs aged 12 years, far longer than most low cost bourbons.","If you take into account the uniqueness stated above and the fact that itâs a far better bourbon than many twice its price, you understand why itâs becoming so hard to find. At around $20-$25 for a 750ml bottle, itâs a flat-out steal. This is one bourbon that actually under-priced. It would have an easy time sitting along side many $40 bourbons.","Does it get better than this? Van Winkle recipe, aged 12 years, low price and an above-average nose/palate/finish? There are a very few bourbons that can flat-out beat it without blowing your budget. Also donât let the Wellerâs line of underwhelming bottle design and labels deter you from finding the gem. The money Buffalo Trace saves on the bottle itself is passed along to the consumer. As their shortages continue, if you see a bottle of W.L. Weller 12 Year, grab it.

210, Straight Bourbon,"Sazerac Company, Inc.",Buffalo Trace,90,NAS (Said to be around 7 years), $30 (2016),"The wheat grain makes this bourbon sweet and a very pleasant sip. The vanilla and caramels really come through more as they hit the tongue. Itâs not a very complex sip, but at least a pleasant one.","Although it starts sweet, it finishes with some amount of bite. The oak comes through during the finish and provides a bit of warmth to the sip. The bite doesnât last long and acts as more of a finisher than a deal breaker. On some sips the alcohol does reveal itself quite a bit during the finish. Otherwise, the sweet honeysuckle finishes off the sip nicely.","As part of Buffalo Traceâs wheat line, that in itself is reason enough to notice. All of Buffalo Trace's wheat line originates from the same basic mashbill. That includes, Weller Antique 107, Weller 12 Year, BTACâs William Larue Weller and the infamous Pappy Van Winkle line. As the story goes, the Weller barrels are in a different location in Buffalo Trace's warehouses than the Van Winkles barrels, but the basic recipe is the still same. Overall this is one of the most straight-forward bourbon Buffalo Trace puts out. There's not a lot unique or memorable here, but a perfect candidate for an everyday decanter bourbon.","At the $20 range, this is a fantastic bourbon. It may not have the depth of a more expensive bourbon, but itâs one that is relatively easy to find and priced right. If youâre new to bourbon, the Weller line is the place to start your journey. As more people seek this out price is beginning to increase. Be careful with this one. While it's an enjoyable sip, it's not quite a  $35+ bourbon.

211, Straight Bourbon,Medley Family,Sourced,94,NAS, $35 (2014),"The nose on Wathenâs is one of the lightest Iâve experienced. The slightest traces of alcohol are mixed with very light traces of new wood, straw and vanilla. Interestingly I picked up a stronger sense of fresh peeled bananas on top of everything.","The palate doesnât blow you away on this single barrel. Initially, youâre presented with a strong taste of clove and walnuts. Lingering behind that is a light sweet orange citrus taste.","The finish on this bottle of Wathenâs was shorter than what I'd prefer for a single barrel. The finish starts off with a mixture of charred wood and lightly spiced pepper and ends on tones of sugary raisins. While not bad by any means, it also didnât wow me.","This single barrel Wathenâs is interesting. The only sure thing you can count on is that this bourbon has a consistent mashbill (77% corn, 10% rye, and 13% malt).Other than that, little else is known about this bourbon. With no age statement, rumors online suggest the age could be anywhere from 4 to 8 or 9 years. While this allows the Medley family to choose from various barrel samples and bottle the bourbon when they feel itâs ready, it also means that you truly have no idea what youâre drinking. If I had to take a guess based on the color and flavors present, Iâd say this is a 4-6 year old bourbon.","At $35 for this single barrel, it's priced higher than it should be. Youâre not sure how old the bourbon is or where itâs really produced. On top of that, if you really want to drink a single barrel bourbon, you can find a great one for much less or a little more (i.e. Evan Williams Single Barrel for less or Four Roses single barrel for just a few dollars more).","February 14, 2013",Wathen's Single Barrel Bourbon

Itâs definitely got rye spice on the nose, but less alcohol intensity than the proof would suggest. Thereâs a hint of anise along with something elseâ¦ tobacco maybe. Itâs faint but itâs there.","Very tasty. Full-bodied with a good mouthfeel. A warming rye pop hits immediately followed by a sweet and spicy kick. Itâs bright and bold with elements of vanilla and oak underneath. It doesnât taste over-aged by any means, which makes me wonder what a few more years in the barrel might bring.","Unlike the standard WhistlePig, there isnât an intense rye pop in the finish. A hint of burnt brown sugar dances in the background, contrasting the rye spice.The flavors from the sip dissipate fairly evenly resulting in a balanced, medium-length finish. Overall itâs a nice finish to a fairly balanced and refined sip.","A single barrel, barrel proof, 13.5 year, 100% rye mash bill release comprised of 50 total barrels is very unique on paper. But how about the taste? My experience with WhistlePigâs standard offering had me anticipating something quite unique when it came to taste. Instead, my bottle offered a more mainstream flavor profile than I expected. In fact, the polarizing rye pop found in the standard WhistlePigâs finish was not present in this offering. I even tried proofing it down and could not achieve the same result. Aside from lacking that intensely unique rye pop in the finish, itâs still not quite like anything else Iâve tasted or have on my shelfâ¦ and I mean this in a good way.","I have a hard time justifying anything in excess of the $100 mark, so something approaching $200 is quite a stretch. If not for the current boom in the high-end whiskey market, this would never find itâs way out of a liquor store at this price point.Letâs take Pappy Van Winkle 20 year as a comparable, as it also MSRPs in the mid $100 range. With the Pappy, the bourbon in the bottle is delicious, but thereâs the outside influence as well that cannot be ignored. The hype somehow helps justify the pricing in our minds. When other people want something very desperately, we often find ourselves wanting it too. This is not true with The Boss Hog. The black label and pewter top are nice, but not $189 nice. There is no outside force or aftermarket insanity magically helping justify the price in our subconscious. Moreover, most of us have had little experience with The Boss Hog to know whether itâs worth the money or not.Digging deeper into WhistlePig as a company does not make things any better. Although theyâve recently clarified things, WhistePig did not make it clear exactly where their product was from until more recently. The product is from one of three contracted distilleries in the U.S. or imported from one of two distilleries in Canada. Although the companyâs grain to bottle concept is intriguing, it is not whatâs in this yearâs bottle of The Boss Hog. What weâre getting is a sourced whiskey bottled by a company in Vermont. Thatâs not very exciting.The price point with this one requires a leap of faith. I took that leap. What I got in return is a high quality, unique offering that did not disappoint me. I donât regret the purchase, but I also wonât be hunting for The Boss Hog next year. Thereâs just too much good whiskey to choose from for a lot less money. ",Fall 2014,WhistlePig The Boss Hog 2014 The Spirit of Mortimer
213, Straight Bourbon,Cacao Prieto,Sourced (From an undisclosed distillery in Kentucky),91,10 Years, $75 (2018),"Classic bourbon traits waft to the forefront including corn, oak, barrel char, and vanilla. Beneath lay slight hints of apple and raisins. As can be expected for a 91 proof bourbon, there is no ethanol present at all. Sans the flavors themselves being slightly muted, overall the nose is everything you would want out of a classic style bourbon.",The palate starts surprisingly sweet with corn and vanilla mixed with light orange and cherry. There is a surprising dose of heat comprised of rye spice and pepper which commingle nicely with the flavors. For a 10 year old bourbon the lack of oak in the palate is surprising. A really pleasant sip.,"The heat flares up at the start of the finish, but quickly subsides. What remains is a very weird mix of flavors. A dose of pepper is present along with a strange astringent taste that tickles the back of my throat. This is further mixed with a soap-like oaky flavor profile. This lingers for a while, and unfortunately ends this bourbon on a sour note. To be sure it wasnât my glass, I tried out a different glencairn that I cleaned thoroughly with water, and had the same result.","A Kentucky sourced bourbon thatâs proofed down with limestone water from New York. Itâs an interesting enough story to a degree, and the bourbon somewhat hits its mark. Make no mistake, there is no mingling of barrels or blending going on. This is just a straight proofing down of a sourced bourbon using local limestone filtered water. While Iâm sure the company loves this process, many non-distiller producers (NDP) do just this and the end result is a drinkable, traditional tasting bourbon. Besides the odd tasting finish, the flavor profile isnât all that unique or memorable overall, and Iâd be hard pressed to pick this out of a blind tasting.","The value on this bourbon really presented a conundrum for me. On the surface this bourbon seems like itâs overpriced from a pure cost perspective. After all, $75 for a sourced bourbon is on the expensive side, especially when you stop to think that Henry McKenna 10 Year Single Barrel retails for $30. Sure it's not sourced, but shares the 10 year age statement, single barrel status, and has Kentucky origins.In-house distilled whiskeys tend to be the exception to the norm. Sourced bourbon like Rebel Yell 10 Year Single Barrel falls in the $60 range, and  Michter's 10 Year Single Barrel falls in the $120 range. While these arenât apple to apples comparisons in terms of flavor profile, from a sourced product and age range perspective, it gives a decent comparison. Looking at it this way, Widow Jane 10 Year seems to be priced appropriately for the market.However in the end you have to take the actual product into account as being a single barrel doesnât automatically mean itâs a great product. In Widow Janeâs case, the nose and palate are really enjoyable, but the finish ends on such a poor note that is simply hard to ignore. While it may just be the barrel my bottle came from, at $75 Iâm left feeling disappointed.",Ongoing,Widow Jane 10 Year Single Barrel Bourbon
214, Oat Malt Whiskey,Wigle Whiskey,Wigle Whiskey,92,16 Months, $58 (2017),"This nose is a big change from most whiskeys Iâve tried. Oats are clearly the base for this as a strong smell of unsweetened plain oatmeal is readily present and most dominant. This is layered with baking chocolate, brownies, fresh biscotti, roasted malt, and the slightest hint of oak. A really unique combination that is quite enjoyable.","My first thought is how much this tastes like a rich dark beer. The oats carry through to the palate however theyâre noticeably sweetened. Theyâre combined with the flavor of a piece of dark chocolate filled with coffee liqueur, along with faint hints of star anise, vanilla, and the the slightest hint of oak that you have to hunt for. This is a really a unique sipper.","A chewy coffee finish starts up the moment you swallow. This slowly morphs into a slightly dry mixture of baking chocolate and rich malted beer. This is a fantastic finish, with flavors lingering for several minutes, leading to one of the longer finishes I can remember.","Oat whiskeys are not very common. High Westâs Valley Tan was one of the most noteable before it was switched over to its now wheat heavy mashbill. Even then, that release was aged in standard 53 gallon barrels and had a mashbill that was predominantly oats (~85%).After tasting Wigleâs Quaker Strength, Iâm surprised by how rich and flavorful this was for only being aged for 16 months in 15 gallon barrels. This whiskey has a depth that really fools you into believing itâs aged a lot longer than it is. Additionally, I was surprised at how much the oats show through for only being 57% of the mashbill. While the malts definitely add a great combination of flavors to the entire experience, the oats form the bedrock of this whiskey.The entire time I was sipping on this whiskey, I kept thinking to myself just how out there and wild the flavor profile is. It certainly wonât please everyone, but it was refreshing to taste something so unique from an American whiskey. The flavors play magnificently well off of one another considering theyâve barely had any time to age together. It just goes to show that given the right mashbill, even young whiskeys distilled in 15 gallon barrels can produce memorable results.","Itâs hard not to judge this whiskey before taking a sip. Itâs $58 for a whiskey that contains an odd grain choice and thatâs aged in 15 gallon barrels for only 16 months; how could this not be grossly overpriced for what it is? Boy was I completely proven wrong.While $58 is a common price for whiskeys from craft distilleries, itâs still a lot of money to pay for a young whiskey. Amazingly, it delivers on taste in all the right ways. From the moment you smell the uniquely flavorful nose, to the never ending finish, you know that youâre trying something really unique and delicious. This whiskey opened my eyes to what can be done when distilleries that take a chance and try something truly off the wall. Does the associated price tag allow this whiskey to hold up to other traditional bourbons and whiskeys in the same range? Absolutely not. However rest assured, youâre getting a fair value for the juice inside the bottle with Quaker Strength.",November 2016,Wigle Quaker Strength Whiskey
215, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,101,"Blend of 6, 7, and 8-year-old bourbons", $23,A strong blend of toffee and caramel with a hardy amount of alcohol scent is present. Spice and vanilla provide a nice base with additional layers of toasted oak and butterscotch. Overall itâs very likeable with its layers of sweet notes that hit with the perfect intensity.,"Sweet notes of vanilla, maple, and cinnamon are nicely contrasted with oakiness, spice, and char. Like all of Wild Turkeyâs bourbons, the company does an excellent job of balancing flavors and keeping the sweet/spice relationship in check. Wild Turkey is known for their high-rye mashbill and even in their âbudgetâ bourbon, this flavor boldness is present.","The medium-length biting finish gives way to a slightly dry aftertaste. Spice, pepper, and oak dominate over the palateâs sweeter notes. The alcohol taste is definitely more noticeable in Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon than the companyâs other brands. It might be too much for some drinkers while others may revel in its boldness.","The 101 proof expression is Wild Turkey's most well known bourbon and their flagship brand. While they also produce an 80 proof version, itâs the 101 proof expression that immediately comes to mind when âWild Turkeyâ is mentioned. This higher-than-normal proof for a companyâs standard bottle has probably become this bourbon's most beloved attribute. Itâs amazing that just one extra proof point can differentiate a product so much from the 100 proof bottled-in-bond bourbons in the marketplace.Of course none of that would mean anything if the flavor profile couldnât standout on its own. This is one of the most robust flavor profiles available in its price range but one I fear many people (especially new bourbon drinkers) might overlook because of lackluster branding. The turkey branding, while correlating nicely to its companyâs namesake, does little to relate to modern sensibilities. Yes, bourbon and old-fashioned traditions go hand-in-hand, but Wild Turkeyâs branding seems stale and outdated. Even Old Grand-Dad which suffered a similar identity crustiness recently changed their branding. The point is, Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon is a quality product that deserves more fanfare and overall attention than it currently receives and I believe the outdated branding is partly to blame.","The combination of high proof, great price, and flavor qualities of Wild Turkey 101 is really a perfect storm. Sporting both high proof and flavor balance makes it a great sipping bourbon, which can't always be said of budget bourbons. The great price and above-average proof also makes it a great mixing bourbon. Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon almost nails everything you want out of a budget bourbon. Itâs one real point of contention is its overall hotness. Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon is not a smooth bourbon. There are many bourbons on the market with a similar or higher proof point that provide a smoother finish. However the main difference is that many of them also cost a lot more money and youâd probably be hard-pressed to say theyâre truly worth the additional cost.",Ongoing,Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon
216, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,101,NAS, $40 (Liter),"A lively bouquet of caramel, honey, grain, and mint appear overtop of fainter hints of bubblegum, creme brulee, baking spices, and oak. The aromas blend well together and play off one another, yet still retain their original characteristics. The notes are enjoyable and robust like many rye whiskeys, yet still soft enough to keep the nose from being harsh.","At first sip, the intensity of its proof immediately fills my throat and nose with hardy grain and spice. Tucked underneath are more delicates notes of mint, oatmeal, and apple, but they struggle for equal attention. Despite these additional flavors waiting in the wings, the palate comes off as a bit basic because of the dominance of rye spice. Itâs also worth noting the whiskeyâs slight buttery consistency, combined with additional oak notes, goes a long way making up for some of the palateâs straightforward simplicity.","The medium length finish leaves a hot, cinnamon, and spicy aftertaste. As it dissipates, the whiskeyâs oak influence becomes even more noticeable as woody notes overtake the spice. A dry aftertaste then develops in the whiskeyâs final act. There are few surprises thanks to a straightforward and somewhat predictable rye finish.","Wild Turkey 101 Rye was once (and possibly still is) the quintessential rye whiskey. People that are newer to whiskey might not even realize there is such a thing as Wild Turkey 101 Rye, since due to supply constraints, it isnât found in many stores. With the rye revival and MGP-produced rye whiskeys flooding the shelves, Wild Turkeyâs rye whiskeys seem to be diminishing in the public conscience. The company may speak of high demand, but when was the last time anyone spoke fondly of the 81 proof version and how many are even aware of the fact that a 101 proof version exists anymore?It really comes down to the fact that the 81 proof version replaced Wild Turkey 101 Rye as a workhorse whiskey. There arenât a lot of bells and whistles on display here. For rye drinkers looking for a more complex sip from Wild Turkey, theyâre pointed in the direction of the more expensive and unique Russell's Reserve Rye. Wild Turkey 101 Rye is simply a get-down-to-business kind of whiskey.","Because of Wild Turkey 101 Ryeâs dispersed and somewhat shadowy availability throughout the country, the price of it varies greatly. Sold in liter bottles, and ranging from $35-$45, itâs teetering on the high side for what it is. Itâs an adequate sipper at best, as its palate errs a bit on the basic side for that aspect. It works well in cocktails thanks to its proof and spicy traits, but again, its basic composition doesnât bring much additional complexity to a cocktail. Of course some may enjoy that very aspect of this whiskey, but unlike its 101 proof bourbon brother which is priced right, Wild Turkey 101 Ryeâs price and limited availability do the whiskey a disservice. But if youâre lucky and live in a market that still prices it closer to $30 than $40, this deserves a place on your shelf.",Ongoing,Wild Turkey 101 Rye
217, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,91,NAS (A blend of 13-16 year old barrels), $125,"A deep inhale fills the nostrils with a warm yet inviting alcohol burn. Old wood, cigar box, caramel, and vanilla show through. Very nice overall.","Dry, but not overly so. Aged wood, tobacco, cigar box, leather, vanilla, spice, and a hint of char make for a fairly complex sip. Everything is balanced and the individual flavors are fairly subtle here with wood elements being the most dominant although not overbearing.","The finish starts off with a little more alcohol burn than would be expected for the proof, and then youthful notes of caramel and vanilla take over, but only briefly. Aged wood, tobacco, and cigar box pull through and then linger for some time. As a whole the finish transitions quickly from spicy-sweet into woody and bitter.","This is a bourbon that tastes over a decade old and delivers subtle balance as opposed to an in-your-face flavor punch. If youâre looking for another bourbon that pays homage to Jimmy Russellâs 60 years in the industry you certainly wonât find one. However, if youâre looking for an easy-to-sip balanced bourbon with notes of wood evidencing its age you can find other well balanced bourbons with somewhat similar flavor profiles.I wanted to dig a little deeper into the flavor differences between this offering and other Wild Turkey offerings, as well as comparisons with some other limited release bourbons I consider well balanced. For this comparison I pulled out a few bottles from my cabinet: Wild Turkey Tradition, Russellâs Reserve Single Barrel, Eagle Rare 17 (2013), and Parkerâs Heritage Promise of Hope.The balance of flavors in the Diamond Anniversary was most obvious when compared with Wild Turkey Tradition, which I consider a strange mix of flavors despite being a complex and intriguing sip. Diamond Anniversary was more complex and balanced but less exciting and spicy than Russellâs Reserve, which has a unique flavor profile of its own and more intensity due to its 110 proof. The comparisons with Eagle Rare 17 and Parkerâs were more interesting. Despite being the middle child age-wise, I found the Diamond Anniversary to have the most wood characteristics of the bunch, coming off as the eldest. I found the nose and palate to be be brighter and more lively with both the Eagle Rare and Parkerâs as compared with Diamond Anniversary. If given a choice, I would drink Parkerâs, Eagle Rare 17, and then Diamond Anniversary in that order. However, the deeper wood, leather, and tobacco characteristics found in the Diamond Anniversary may be more appealing to those craving a more woody and complex (yet not overly so) sip.","As far as Iâm concerned anything priced over $100 enters a territory of âWhat am I really paying for?â Top notch bourbons can be purchased for under $100, so why pay more? Wild Turkey is steeped in history and Jimmy Russellâs 60 year tenure is a milestone few will attain. With 36,000 bottles released in the United States it will be fairly accessible for those who seek it out. Compare this to the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, which will have a total release of around 31,890 bottles in 2014 - this figure includes total production of ALL 5 offerings combined folks. Although we wonât see Diamond Anniversary bottles sitting on the shelves for too long, this is probably one most enthusiasts will have an opportunity to buy if they so choose as the price point is just high enough to make people think twice before purchasing. Donât expect to be blown away simply by the juice with this one, instead go into it knowing youâre paying a premium for a well-balanced bourbon that pays homage to a great man and you wonât be disappointed. If you donât know who Jimmy Russell is, buy something else.",August 2014,Wild Turkey Diamond Anniversary Bourbon
218, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,101,"NAS (According to Eddie Russell, bottles are between 8-9 years)", $55 (2017),"Overall itâs very sweet with an interesting mix of key lime and pecan pie. Hints of citrus, leather, and spice are also present. It has a thicker, more full bodied nose than the normal Wild Turkey 101.","Like the nose, the palate is on the sweet side with generous amounts of caramel, vanilla, orange, and cinnamon present. It also has a really nice balance of rye and corn. Leather and oak notes help balance the palate from some of its sweeter aspects.","Medium-long finish with hearty notes of rye and leather. Itâs not too hot, yet it leaves an agreeable amount of flavor in your mouth. The finish is well balanced between the lighter/sweet beginning and the slightly dry, oaky finish. It leaves a nice aftertaste of brown sugar and a hint of cinnamon.","Thereâs not a lot that is obviously unique with this bourbon. Its flavor profile has few surprises and follows the bold, rye-forward Wild Turkey style. What makes the bourbon special is its balance of the flavor spectrum. The corn flavor is offset by the rye spiciness. The sweetness is offset by oak and leather flavors. Although this is most likely the goal of any master distiller, few really nail this delicate balance. There are many bourbons that have a particular aspect of their flavor profile that makes them great, but a bourbon that provides a deep and layered flavor experience is much harder to find.","At more than double the price of the standard Wild Turkey 101, purchasing Kentucky Spirit isnât an impulse buy. It loses the youthful taste of Wild Turkey 101 and it provides a deeper, more balanced flavor profile. The $45 - $55 price range is a growing segment of the bourbon market and many of the bottles in that price range provide stiff competition. Elijah Craig Barrel Proof, Blantonâs, and even Wild Turkeyâs own Russelâs Reserve Single Barrel are all fantastic bourbons in that price range. I would probably rate Kentucky Spirit below those in a direct face off, which means to me that this bourbon is priced on the high side. Even Wild Turkeyâs own barrel proof Rare Breed costs $35, so itâs a tad perplexing why Kentucky Spirit is priced where it is.",Ongoing,Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit Bourbon
219, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,86,8 Years, $40,"A very sweet bouquet of caramel, vanilla, and toffee. Nutmeg and oak flow throughout providing additional layering. Overall the aromas are bright and enjoyable and hard to dislike. Although the nose is overall mild in intensity, it still has a satisfying impact despite its 86 proof.",Its creamy mouthfeel nicely compliments the bourbonâs sweeter notes of honey and orange. Spice is layered throughout and seasoned oak provides a sturdy base. Itâs well balanced and pleasant.,A pop of heat followed by a mild dryness powers the finish. Caramel and spice trail off giving way to a hint of smoke on the backend that is gratifying but fleeting. Nicely constructed and a fitting end to this bourbon.,"When Wild Turkey hired McConaughey [making him the highest paid creative director in the ad industry] they were most likely going to want to get the most out of the arrangement. They not only wanted to bank on McConaugheyâs name and have him write and star in their commercials, but they also wanted his help developing a new Wild Turkey expression with his name on it. Enter Longbranch.A new release typically needs a story and Wild Turkey is never one short on stories (e.g. Forgiven). You can read about Longbranchâs extended story from the company's press release, but what really sets it apart from Wild Turkeyâs other products is its charcoal filtering. While certainly not revolutionary, the two step process, first with charcoal made from American white oak and then with charcoal made from Texas mesquite wood, is impactful on the final product. The smokiness isnât as heavy as say a Corsair whiskey, but Wild Turkey probably wasnât going for that either. Itâs a mild flavor alteration to their standard bourbon and when itâs combined with older stock (the current release contains 8 year bourbon) it produces a bourbon that gently offers something different. Itâs less fiery and spicy, more sweet and oaky with a hint of smoke that makes it come off as a bourbon that was made to please. Its 86 proof complements this idea as an easy-to-drink bourbon thatâs inoffensive in every way.","Longbranch squarely fits into an open spot in the companyâs portfolio. Proof-wise, itâs nestled between their 80 and 101 bourbons, with Russellâs and Rare Breed filling out the high proof range. Itâs $40 price fits between their $20 range 101 Bourbon and their $50 and creeping Russellâs line. The issue is with Rare Breed. Generally found in the $35 and 115 proof range, it conflicts with it. The obvious explanation for this is that Wild Turkey hopes Longbranch swings wide. Competing more with the Woodford Reserve and Basil Haydenâs of the world for mainstream reach, Longbranchâs proof and flavor profile was crafted for such a task. It easily stands up to those bourbons in terms of quality and price.Longbranch will unfortunately never escape the question of whether it's worth the $15 premium over 101 Bourbon at 15 lower proof points. This type of question is always hard to answer and arguable unfair, but when you factor in Longbranchâs age and altered Wild Turkey flavor profile, it offers enough to warrant its price. In fact, Iâm a bit surprised the company didnât price this closer to $50 based on its celebrity connection alone.",April 2018,Wild Turkey Longbranch
220, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,86.8,17 Years, $150,"Though subtle, this bourbon has a lot of character on the nose. Wood characteristics dominate (though donât overpower) with a mixture of older seasoned wood and tobacco at the forefront along with a layered depth I canât quite describe underneath. A bit of the traditional caramel and vanilla are there too, balancing things out. Itâs enticing and lures you right into the sip, almost promising to deliver something spectacular.","A bit of spice hits first along with a bit of sweetness. Like the nose, wood characteristics dominate the sip, though itâs not overbearing. Cigar box, tobacco, and seasoned wood layer overtop a hint of burnt brown sugar. It has a lightweight but creamy mouthfeel, however it does not seem watered down like many of the Orphan Barrel bourbons which are of similar proof and age. It is characteristically âWild Turkey,â though much more subtle than what Iâm typically used to in their Wild Turkey 101 and even slightly more subtle than last yearâs Diamond Anniversary. Though itâs quite enjoyable and layered in depth, it actually does taste ""old"" with a bit of a musty flavor. It also lacks any bright and lively characteristics like those found in some other older releases such as Eagle Rare 17 Year and Barterhouse, which isnât necessarily bad, just something worth noting.","It finishes nicely with a short to medium length tapering of flavors that are again dominated by wood characteristics. It leaves a good aftertaste and doesnât turn bitter as older bourbons sometimes have a tendency to do (as a result of over-aging). This makes for a nice balanced ending to the sip. It lacks any pop in the finish which I would attribute to its thin mouthfeel, though oddly a coating in the mouth remains (this might help explain my ""creamy"" mouthfeel description in the Palate section). Unfortunately this also means the flavors, though good, dissipate a bit faster than I would like.","Aside from certain limited releases, as proof decreases, excitement often decreases along with it. Letâs be honest, unless thereâs aftermarket frenzy, the masses seem to get more excited when the proof is higher rather than lower. Not surprisingly, the most common criticism of Masterâs Keep upon its debut was its abnormally low proof. But understanding that it came out of the barrel at 89 proof (a bit of proof is lost during filtration, bringing the final bottling proof down to 86.8) ironically makes this all the more interesting to me. This went into the barrel at 107 proof then lost 18 of those proof points over its 17 years of aging, a rate of about one proof point per year. Though I donât have access to a large spectrum of data on this phenomenon, anecdotally I would say this is pretty uncommon. In fact, this particular bourbon inspired us to create an infographicdepicting bourbon barrel aging.Unlike many bourbons that come out of the barrel at a higher proof and are either watered down prior to bottling or sold as mouth-searingly high barrel proof monsters, Masterâs Keep aged in a very different way. Wild Turkey attributes this to a unique, though accidental aging process. The company ran out of rickhouse space and was forced to age the barrels that would eventually become Masterâs Keep in brick rickhouses at the Old Crow Distillery, which were located in a low lying valley. Barrels were then moved a number of times and eventually made their way back to the wood and metal rickhouses at the Wild Turkey Distillery.As interesting as the story may be, the unique concept of lowering proof within the barrel arising from a non-traditional aging environment only really matters if itâs somehow evident in the taste. Fortunately, the taste and mouthfeel characteristics of Masterâs Keep are unique, rewarding my curiosity with an interesting end result. Thinking about this bourbonâs unique aging process while sipping this makes it all the more enjoyable. Although aging bourbon for 17 years isnât incredibly unique, it is Wild Turkey's oldest release to date.","Wild Turkey has added $25 to each of their premium limited releases over the past few years - Tradition at $100, Diamond Anniversary at $125, and now Masterâs Keep at $150. I scored Diamond Anniversaryâs value low in my review, giving it a 1.5 out of 5 barrels on our scale. As predicted, Diamond Anniversary still sits on shelves locally and now ironically finds itself in competition with the newly released Masterâs Keep.Iâm also a Wild Turkey fan, and have been quietly hoping they would hit a limited release out of the park overturning what I would call a ho-hum limited release streak from a consumer's point of view. While I truly enjoy Masterâs Keep and the story behind it, itâs still quite pricey all things considered. Wild Turkey doesnât have enough momentum from their past few limited releases to push the price point up another $25 on this one, and quite frankly it's good, but not good enough to support $150 a bottle. Sure, 17 years is the highest aged bourbon ever to be released by Wild Turkey, yet we have grown accustomed to high age statements with many other highly sought after limited releases and even some not so limited ones (ahem, Orphan Barrel). Our bottle of Masterâs Keep is Bottle No. 62402, so assuming these are numbered sequentially itâs possible Masterâs Keep is not so limited either.On the positive side, the bottle design is outstanding. The shape, feel, raised glass turkey, and impressively heavy copper-wood stopper give the bottle a high quality feel that I appreciate, though a part of me would rather see a more simple bottle and a few more dollars in my pocket. The box it comes in is also of nice quality, but I would definitely rather save the money on whatever cost the box builds into the MSRP plus the additional cost related to transport as it takes up so much extra space. Instead of jumping $25 from last yearâs Diamond Anniversary, I would have really liked to see the price actually drop $25 landing at $100. Considering suggested retail pricing for other limited releases including the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection, Four Roses, and the Parkerâs Heritage Collection, Masterâs Keep should really be priced more along those lines if they intend to generate enough stir in the enthusiast community around this one in order to move it quickly and create a buzz rather than have it collect dust on liquor store shelves.",August 2015,Wild Turkey Master's Keep Bourbon
221, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,104,Blend of bourbons aged 10 - 20 Years, $150,"An expressive and gratifying nose of typical Wild Turkey aromas consisting of toffee, orange peel, and caramel. Oak and butterscotch provide a rich base along with another aroma thatâs hard to pin down. At times this scent reminds me of a belgian beer, and others, a bouquet of roses. Itâs faint and a bit odd, but interesting when you get a whiff of it.","The flavors start off quite gentle like Wild Turkeyâs limited releases often do, before ramping up like the companyâs popular Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon is known for. The flavors repeatedly bounce from sweeter notes, to oaky ones, before settling on strong baking spice notes. If the sweeter notes were more prominent like they often were with older Wild Turkey releases, this palate would be top notch.","A long finish thatâs bold with its oak and spice notes. There is a bit of clove, tannins, and ethanol on the aftertaste that counters the better aspects of the finish. Itâs not overly deep, but the sweet notes are able to peek out from the strong oak front just enough to add a little necessary layering. I just would like to see a little more of it.","Probably the thing youâll most notice when you take a sip of Wild Turkey Decades is its boldness. After Wild Turkey Diamond Anniversary and Wild Turkey Masterâs Keep 17 Year coming in under 100 proof, the company finally comes out strong at 104 proof with Decades. Wild Turkey is never one for high proofs, as evidenced by their barrel proof offering the last couple of years at 112.8 proof, but sometimes the numbers donât tell the whole story.Wild Turkeyâs barrel entry proof has always been on the low side compared to its competitors. This often results in a fuller flavor at a lower proof and why their 101 Bourbon has the reputation it does for being so bold. Despite this, Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon and their single barrel version of it, Kentucky Spirit, actually tastes watered down compared to Decades. Even though Wild Turkey Rare Breed comes in hotter at 112.8 proof, it canât match the richness of Decades. This might not make it very unique compared to other bourbons on the market, but within its own bourbon family, it definitely stands out.","Once again the bourbon boom inflates yet another limited release. Decades comes in less that Russellâs Reserve 1998âs $250 price tag, and thankfully at the same $150 as 2015âs Wild Turkey Masterâs Keep. Regardless of what constitutes the new normal regarding limited releases, $150 is just too much for whatâs in this bottle. Russellâs Reserve 1998 might have cost $250 when it was released, but what was in the bottle backed it up and it quickly sold out. In many parts of the country you can still find Diamond Anniversary and Masterâs Keep on shelves, which is a good indication theyâre overpriced. Decades is good bourbon, maybe even great, but not amazing enough to constitute $150. One of my ideal bourbons is a richer, higher proof Kentucky Spirit and while Decades comes close to it, the lack of strong sweet notes keeps this bourbon from reaching greater heights. At three times the price of Kentucky Spirit, close isnât good enough.",February 2017,Wild Turkey Master's Keep Decades Bourbon
222, Straight Bourbon Finished in Oloroso Sherry Casks,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,101,NAS (Contains bourbon between 12-15 years), $150 (2018),"The classic backbone of Wild Turkey aromas are present, consisting of sweet mixed fruit, toffee, and caramel. This yearâs Masterâs Keep also packs an additional punch of cherry, oak, and a hard-to-ignore sherry influence that billows out of the glass. Itâs a gentle mixture that nicely blends bourbon and sherry scents to satisfying results.","A creamy mouthfeel presents a balanced joining of cherry, grape, vanilla, and oak. Itâs sweet without tasting overly sweet and fruity without tasting overly fruity. The sherry influence is nicely presented as it gently adds dimension to the bourbon without overpowering it.","A bit harsh with a strong oak and spicy front that lingers. Apricot, vanilla, and grape round it out which is more dry than sweet, and more adequate than satisfying. Itâs not a full-on miss, as it adds some weight to the flavor profile, but hard to celebrate either.","Despite being a company steeped in tradition, Wild Turkey has never been a company to shy away from trying new things. They were quick to do a single barrel and barrel proof when those became a thing to do. They have a flavored whiskey with Wild Turkey Honey. They harnessed a gimmicky story with Forgiven, export-only releases with a Wild Turkey 13 Year Bourbon, and somehow come up with a new way to sell a limited edition bourbon every year.  Surprisingly, barrel finished bourbon is not something the company has dabbled much with on the consumer level. This might be why when I heard they were doing a barrel finished bourbon it seemed so strange to me.Sherry finishing isnât a terribly common way to finish whiskey, but Wild Turkey certainly isnât the first to do it. Minor Case, Belle Meade, Westland, Barrell Craft Spirits, Hillrock, and Wyoming Whiskey have all taken a shot at it. What is unique, is one of Kentuckyâs majors doing it, but truthfully does that even matter anymore? The main thing that makes Revival stand out, is that it contains 12-15 year old bourbon and is something the aforementioned whiskeys canât claim. The result is a bourbon that has more complexity and overall maturity in its composition. Its age, both in the bourbon stock and Oloroso casks, makes a noticeable difference on the outcome and a better and more unique product because of it.","Barrel finished whiskeys usually command an increased price due to sourcing the used barrels, extra handling, and time aging. That part is easy to understand, but adding an additional premium on top of an already premium priced product is harder. As much as I enjoy the occasional barrel finished whiskey, I generally donât purchase many and have a hard time wrapping my head around a $150 one. For all of the great things Revival has going for it, any barrel finished bourbon for that matter has a hard time commanding this price. It might be nothing new for a scotch drinkers, but bourbon drinkers still havenât quite come around to high-priced barrel finished bourbons. Simply put, yes it's well-made, but itâs overall gentleness will make it hard to justify its high price. Wild Turkey is heading in the right direction, but they might be a little bit too far ahead with their price.",June 2018,Wild Turkey Master's Keep Revival Bourbon
223, Straight Rye,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,109 Proof (Cask Strength),9 Years (Press release states a maximum of 11 years), $175 (2019) ,"A sweet and rustic aroma showcases oaky pine, honey, green apple, orange rind, and lemon zest. A quick swirl of the glass increases the richness of these scents, which makes a beautiful impression. This is not your typical rye nose, as it is much more flushed with flavors and complex than you usually find in many ryes on the market.","The sip immediately hits you with a twinge of green apple and cinnamon roll sweetness, before transitioning into a more oak-heavy, slightly minty, and burnt butterscotch affair. It has a satisfying amount of heat that helps elevate the complexity of its flavors and doesnât simply overpower them. The flavors are enjoyable, but not over the top.","The oak comes through hard on the finish resulting in a noticeably dry way to end the sip. The oak is nicely complemented by cocoa, rye spice, clove, and black pepper in keeping with the whiskeyâs rustic flavor profile. Itâs not mind blowing by any means, but itâs unique tasting enough to make up for it.","Weâve talked at length in our previous reviews of Wild Turkey Masterâs Keep editions about the company's struggles with their limited releases in regards to how tempered they come across. At first taste, it seemed like Cornerstone was going to follow suit. It most likely wonât wow you with its initial sip. Itâs not overly fruity or sweet like some ryes, nor is it as creamy or punchy as others. I tasted it against a number of available and older released ryes and found that it didnât make a great first impression right out of the gate like some of them did. It wasnât until I got to âknowâ the whiskey that its virtues emerged. This is a âbarely legalâ rye, meaning, its rye percentage clocks in just over the legal requirement of 50%. This results in a rye having a lot of flavor similarities to a bourbon and lacking the rye flavor uniqueness of others that push higher rye grain percentages. That is one place where Cornerstone misfires in regards to its uniqueness. Cornerstoneâs interesting finish aside, Wild Turkey ryes just donât lean into their rye component enough as they should. On the other hand, Cornerstone offers what few rye whiskeys are ever able to offer to the degree it does: complexity.Complexity isnât a quality thatâs always immediately noticeable, and explains why Cornerstone tastes a bit unimpressive at first sip. It doesnât hit you with grandiose flavors. Instead, this is a sipping rye, and despite many ryes wanting to be a sipping rye, there are few currently available on the market that do it anywhere as well as Cornerstone does.","For years the majority of limited release whiskeys have settled into the $100-$200 range. There are outliers, but most play in this space. The Masterâs Keep series debuted at $150 and had maintained that price point for three years. Prior to this series and during the rapid boom of bourbon popularity, Wild Turkey was raising their limited releases' price point $25 with every subsequent release. Where $150 was harder to swallow four years ago, the series has grown into its price point, but the question remains: Will consumers swallow another $25 increase this year after the price staying stagnant for the three years prior?2019 is special in that its a year that is seeing multiple limited release ryes. Parkerâs Heritage Heavy Char Barrels Rye is 8 years old and priced at $150, and Kentucky Owl Rye Batch 3 is 10 years old for $200. Limited release ryes typically command a higher price on average due to their lower overall release numbers. On the other hand, ryes are often a harder sell to mainstream drinkers and despite growing popularity, donât see the same demand as bourbon. Itâs hard to call rye a niche product anymore, but limited release ryes still somewhat are. Cornerstoneâs price lands in-between the latest Parkerâs and Kentucky Owlâs batch from this year. It doesnât have the same flavor gratification as prior Kentucky Owl Rye batches did, but offers a degree of sip sophistication that isnât all that common with ryes. Although I wouldnât fault anyone for demanding a $175 product wow you more than Cornerstone might, itâs at least within the overall quality range of its closest competitors. However, complexity will only take you so far, and when someone spends this much on a bottle of whiskey they may demand more. Despite being quite satisfied by Cornerstone, I still kind of wanted more for my money. ",,Wild Turkey Masterâs Keep Cornerstone
224, Straight Bourbon,Campari Group,Wild Turkey,112.8,"NAS (blend of 6, 8, and 12 year old bourbons)", $35,Bold and spicy. Subtle hints of raw grains mingle with peppery seasoned wood. Rye spice is most prominent along with a healthy dose of alcohol that tingles my nostrils.,"It has a big, spicy pop upfront. Bold rye, pepper, and a small amount of seasoned oak give way to a developing sweetness. From nose to palate it has a fairly singular focus on spicy elements. While not bad, itâs rather one-dimensional up to this point.","Spicy rye and seasoned oak carry over into the finish, however sweet cane sugar, light caramelized wood, and vanilla take over as the spice dissipates. The sweetness lingers for some time with only subtle hints of rye spice remaining in the background. Itâs an enjoyable finish you can chew on and without question the highlight of each sip.","Rare Breed was first released in 1991 and along with Bookers, remains one of the longest running barrel proof bourbons on the market. Anecdotally speaking, I feel Rare Breed is not given as much attention as it deserves. This is possibly due to its proof being on the lower end of the spectrum for a barrel proof bourbon, along with other Wild Turkey brands that may cannibalize its own consumer base to some extent.Ironically, the companyâs flagship Wild Turkey 101 is considered high proof with respect to its competition at the price point. Itâs said to be around 6-8 years old and only about 11 proof points lower than this batch of Rare Breed. The company also bottles Russellâs Reserve Single Barrel under their Russellâs Reserve line, a nearly identically proofed premium single barrel bourbon thatâs typically around 8-10 years old. There are other Wild Turkey products in this age/proof range, but the point is I enjoy both of these products more than the current batch of Rare Breed and they provide boundaries for me with respect to the Wild Turkey family of bourbons. Wild Turkey 101 is a more flexible option at a slightly lower price point and Russellâs Reserve Single Barrel is a more premium option at a slightly higher price point. They both offer characteristic âWild Turkeyâ flavor profiles and theyâre both really good, so much so we included each of them on our âBest Ofâ bourbon lists within their respective price ranges. As a result itâs not immediately apparent why I would buy Rare Breed when both of these options are available. Itâs only after further tasting that Iâve come to better appreciate some of the nuances of the Rare Breed brand and what it has to offer within Wild Turkeyâs lineup.Since Rare Breed is batched and each batch can be identified by batch number or proof, I took the opportunity to compare this to the only other batch I had on hand, a sample of the very first batch released in 1991 which we received courtesy of Josh from Red, White & Bourbon. Batch 1 is a standout, by comparison with the 112.8 proof batch in review, but also by comparison with other bourbons in general. I can fully appreciate why Josh describes it as â...one of the best bourbons ever bottled.â In my own comparison, I found Batch 1 to have a more complex and inviting nose, more depth and complexity in the palate, and an oakier, drier, and more mellow finish than the 112.8 proof batch.By comparison to other non-Wild Turkey bourbons on the market however, the 112.8 proof batch of Rare Breed shines a little brighter. Itâs Wild Turkey flavor profile in true barrel proof form offering big spice upfront and a long, complex, and enjoyable finish. As Wild Turkeyâs barrel entry proof ranges from 107 to 115, it results in a relatively low barrel proof, which could be considered a positive attribute when compared with non-barrel proof offerings of a similar proof that are diluted with the addition of water after being dumped. While a higher barrel entry proof may yield a more flavorful barrel proof bourbon, some would argue the higher barrel entry proof is actually a cost savings measure taken by distilleries to push up to the maximum allowable 125 barrel entry proof to be considered bourbon. This ultimately yields a higher barrel proof and allows for more water to be cut into their final non-barrel proof products in order to increase the overall production volume per barrel. Considering what Rare Breed can be as evidenced by Batch 1 along with some of the other excellent Wild Turkey bourbons, Iâm all in for getting behind the concept of a lower barrel entry proof. While I certainly enjoy the heavy hitters, not every barrel proof bourbon needs to be a mouth scorcher, after all.","While this batch of Rare Breed is not my favorite product currently available from Wild Turkey and I even prefer their lower priced Wild Turkey 101 to it, itâs still a barrel proof blend of various aged bourbons for just a few dollars more than mid-$20 range budget bourbons. Itâs the lowest cost barrel proof bourbon offered by a major Kentucky distillery and by that measure it could even be considered a bargain at $35. As evidenced by my own comparison with Batch 1 as well as other comparison reviews with different batches however, this particular batch does not necessarily represent the best Wild Turkey has offered and I would guess Wild Turkey has skewed more heavily toward the 6 year old component in the batch. Regardless, Rare Breed is a staple that should be in every bourbon enthusiastsâ liquor cabinet. Now that Iâve spent more time getting to know it a little better, that includes my own.",Ongoing,Wild Turkey Rare Breed 112.8 Proof Bourbon
225, Rye,The Willett Distillery (also known as Kentucky Bourbon Distillers Ltd.),"MGP, aged and finished by Willett",103.4,7 years aged and ~90 days finished, $140,"The first scent to hit my nose is orangeâ¦and a lot of it! The orange is both a citrusy scent along with a distinctive orange rind aroma. Beneath that I smell light rye notes mixed with oak trying to break through. Those rye notes however, have a hard time pushing past the orange profile which really dominates the nose here. Not unpleasant, but not quite the profile Iâm going after either when I want to drink a whiskey.","Wow is this a funky palate! Orange is still very much upfront and present, along with distinctive notes of a thin sugar molasses, fresh wood, allspice, white pepper and rye. The palate is both distinctly sweet and ever so slightly spicy. It actually nails exactly what I would expect from aging a rye in a Curacao barrel. A well balanced mix of citrus and rye.","The finish is light and airy to start. The sweet taste of orange is present, however, much less so than what was found in the nose and palate. Instead, you mainly find a more traditional finish that you would with a young rye, with earthy woody notes mingled with rye spice and light pepper. The finish lingers for awhile and continuously morphs from light and airy to an increasingly drier level as time went on. The initial sweet flavors morph to a leathery old wood taste that made it seem older than the seven years it spent in the barrel and not necessarily in a good way.","You have to hand it to Willett on this one, as this has to be one of the more unique products on the market. While you see so many barrel finished whiskeys, many have been aged in wine barrels while so few have been successfully aged in other spirit barrels. Angelâs Envy Rye immediately pops into my mind as an exception due to it being aged in used rum barrels, however the flavor profile is so different and much too sweet to make it a fair comparison. Additionally, Willett took the time to import the barrels from France and chose a liquor that pairs decently with a rye. Whether you love it or you hate it, nothing on the market truly tastes like XCF.","While barrel finished whiskeys are all the rage nowadays, at $140 this is one pricey bottle. While other barrel finished whiskeys are selling for around $100 or less (e.g. Angels Envy Rye, High West A Midwinter Nightâs Dram), Willett has chosen a price that youâd normally see on the secondary market. I have a hard time justifying the price tag being charged for XCF. Yes itâs tasty and very unique, however, itâs being sold for about $40-50 more than it should be. Sure it costs money to import barrels from France, however greed seems to have gotten the better of Willet on this one. Hopefully we donât see more distillers pricing their new products at perceived secondary pricing like Willett did, as it scares me to think what the future bourbon market may look like.",November 2014,Willett Exploratory Cask Finish Version 1.0
226, Straight Rye,The Willett Distillery (also known as Kentucky Bourbon Distillers Ltd.),The Willett Distillery,109.4,2 Years, $35 (2014),"Lively with youthful notes. A little burn which would be expected at this proof. Florals, botanicals, and gin come together with a good dose of raisins pulling through towards the end. A hint of the white dog element can be detected, but strangely in a good way.","The florals, botanicals, and gin are here as well. A little menthol comes forth, along with fresh cut grass and some spice. All of these flavors lay nicely on a bed of raisins, which makes for a good balance of sweet and spice. The white dog element is also present here, but again in a strange and welcome way. Itâs youthful, but fun and balanced none-the-less.","Long and warm. Sometimes strange flavors come out in the finish, but not here. This is surprisingly good.","This has been a highly anticipated release being the first in over 30 years that was actually distilled by the Willett company themselves. Aside from the rich history behind this bottle, this release is most interesting to me when you consider the quality and complexity relative to itâs age, and then consider the future releases yet to come at higher ages. Iâm fortunate to own a bottle, so that gave me the opportunity to try this on multiple occasions. I liked it more and seemed to gain a greater appreciation for it each time I sipped it. I also put it against two other very unique ryes - WhistlePig and High West Double Rye. Just as they do, this Willett stands out. Although the unaged element (aka white dog) is present here, it plays with my senses making me re-think the whole idea of unaged whiskey. Had I not had an association with unaged whiskey in the first place I may not have even related it to unaged whiskey here - it becomes just another flavor element. It shows obvious youth but somehow itâs ok here, not nauseating as has been my experience with some unaged whiskeys. It all ends up coming together fairly nicely making for, quite possibly, the best a two year rye could ever get.","Two years old for about $40. Doesnât sound that great on paper, but this one is worth it. Although the Willett Distillery has been around for a while theyâre still considered a craft distiller, so that alone puts the price within reason as the $35+ price point is the norm for craft distillery whiskey where the product is young or comes without an age statement. As future higher-aged vintages of this are released I would expect the price to increase fairly significantly and demand in the aftermarket to skyrocket. Until then, this is an incredibly unique tasting rye with a rich history for less than $50. Itâs a solid deal.",June 2014,Willett Rye 2 Year
227, Straight Bourbon,Heaven Hill,Heaven Hill,115,14 Years, $250 (2017),"A rich earthy base consisting of oak, lightly toasted caramel, honey, white pepper, and aged leather. Taking a deep inhale transports me back to walking around one of Heaven Hillâs rickhouses. Surprisingly, the 115 proof nose is tame and allows you to take a deep breath without being hit with any ethanol. This is a classically well-rounded bourbon nose that highlights all the best parts of what makes bourbon what it is.","The 115 proof shines through in the palate. Baking cinnamon, red hot candies, vanilla, leather, and a dash of tabasco are all blended together with a warming heat that intensifies the longer you hold this bourbon in your mouth. This palate could have easily been sweeter than necessary, however itâs tempered by a dry leather undertone with that dash of tabasco to round things out. Itâs a nice combination that allows all of the flavors to play nicely off one another to expertly showcase how a well developed 14 year old bourbon can taste.","Heat carries through to the finish, as well as faint undertones of vanilla and the red hots along with leather and tobacco. The sweeter parts fade away to leave a lingering aged leather in their place, while the heat settles in the core of your stomach. While shorter than I was hoping for, it rounds out the experience in a delectable way.","As I reviewed this bourbon I kept thinking about what might make it unique. Is it the fact itâs a high aged single barrel which you donât see too often? Or how about the fact that itâs sporting a higher than average proof which is always nice to see? Is it the fact that itâs a limited release, even though a larger number of bottles than typically are found in a William Heavenhill were put to market based on the fact that 30 barrels were selected? Coincidentally, the recently released Knob Creek 25th Anniversary release shares many of these same characteristics. In short, none of these individual characteristics make this bourbon unique, but thatâs only part of the story.What does make this bourbon unique, strangely enough, is the fact that it sports such a  predominantly classic bourbon profile that has become increasingly harder to come by. The flavors showcase a fantastic bourbon and theyâre highlighted perfectly in each part of the experience - the nose, palate, and finish. The bourbon continues to deliver as you sip on it and the experience is something that Iâm often chasing when trying new bourbons. Bookerâs 25th Anniversary comes to mind as being near the same experience. Itâs ironic that in a time when distilleries are experimenting with various aging methods, finishes, and other new techniques, sometimes sticking to the tried and true formula for bourbon results in a perfectly timed product in the market.","So this is what the bourbon world has come to. A 14 year old single barrel bourbon being sold for $250. If you told me this even one year ago I would have laughed at that thought. But in today's current bourbon centric landscape, all I can do is shrug my shoulders and think that it sounds about right. It makes the slightly younger Knob Creek 25th Anniversary coming in at $120 less seem like a steal by comparison.Yes the bourbon is good, but itâs by no means the best that Iâve had, or will most likely have in the next few months. What youâre paying here is for exclusivity, pure and simple. This isnât a high proof monster like past releases of William Heavenhill have been, or even something truly unique like the recent Pre-Fire distillery-only release. The fact of the matter is youâre paying for a really great single barrel bourbon that exemplifies what a honey barrel really means. Itâs just a shame you have to pay this price to experience it, because at the end of the day, this is one super pricey bourbon.Can you blame Heaven Hill? In order to buy this bourbon, they forced buyers to purchase a $20 tasting tour and sit through the 45 minute session where you get to taste 5-6 of their products. Even this forced experience still doesnât stop this from flying off the shelves. Nor does it stop the flippers. In the small group tasting tour that I participated in, I watched no less than five people actually opt not to taste any of the bourbons and openly talk about how they were there only to buy the bourbon to flip it. Itâs a sad state of affairs, and it only makes me wonder how much more Heaven Hill will charge for the next edition of William Heavenhill and what hoops one will have to jump through to buy it. Again, can all blame be put on Heaven Hill for this?",May 2017 (Gift Shop only),William Heavenhill 5th Edition
228, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,136.3,"12 Year, 1 Months", $70 (2013),"Aggressive. Although that is to be expected of a 136 proof bourbon, but whatâs surprising is its less than expected burn. An intense load of flavors hits your tongue at first sip: so much so, itâs almost hard to pick it apart. This rich flavor isnât overpowered by the alcohol, but rather it overpowers the alcohol. There are so many flavors that hit your tongue all at once that it can be a shock. It opens with caramel, honey and butterscotch, but quickly gives way to its oaky foundation with hints of tobacco.",Long. Very long. Rich and complex flavors swirl with wood being the easiest to name first. The burn has a way of lingering much like the flavors do. Even the smallest of sips pack a flavor punch. Deep profile indeed.,"William Larue Weller is in the top ranks for uniqueness. A barrel proof wheater is a rarity in todayâs bourbon landscape. Few companies make wheat based bourbon, let along a barrel proof version. With Pappy Van Winkle being the commercial success it is, itâs a surprise more distillers havenât announce plans to expand into the wheat game. It will be interesting to see how long Buffalo Trace can maintain its levels of wheated bourbon. With currently Weller Special Reserve, Weller Antique 107, Weller 12 yr, the Van Winkle line (10 yr, 12 yr, 15 yr, 20 yr and soon 23 yr) thatâs a lot of bourbon that all share the same basic mashbill. That being said, the Weller might not be as sophisticated in its palate as the Pappy line, but it makes up for it in flavor shock value.","With William Larue Weller being a barrel proof version of Weller 12 yr at 3 Â½ times the price, is it a good value? A mere five years ago you would have gotten a collective âNo.â Now with ever rising demand versus supply issues and an inflation of bourbon prices across the board, the answer changes to yes, this is a good value. There is very little on the shelves that it can be compared to, both in what it is and how it tastes.","This bourbon could be classified under professional level. A better understanding of the bourbon landscape, Buffalo Traceâs wheated bourbon line and a developed palate all help make William Larue Weller a fascinating bourbon to drink. Of course anyone can have fun drinking this one, but that extra layer of knowledge brings with it additional reasons to notice it.",Fall 2013,William Larue Weller 2013 Release
229, Straight Bourbon,Sazerac Company Inc.,Buffalo Trace,140.2,"12 Year, 3 Months", $80 (2014),"At 140.2 proof, the nose surprisingly has a lack of alcohol scent to it. Instead, it has wonderful sweet notes of vanilla, caramel, confectionery sugar and fried dough, which are all in full force here. It may not have the most unique scented nose, but itâs amazingly rich and pleasant.","Dark fruit, toasted oak, cinnamon, pecan, smoke and brown sugar. The palate isnât as broad as itâs deep. There are more complementary flavors this year and those flavors have a good amount of depth to them. This more focused range of flavors helps make this yearâs WLW very balanced and tight.","The thick, syrupy and deliciously rich body of this yearâs WLW finishes exactly the way it should: with a perfect length, amount of heat and flavor that trails off elegantly. The toasted oak flavors last throughout the finish, but this year theyâre better balanced with the rest of the palateâs flavors.","One could say that in a year that also saw two other barrel proof wheat whiskeys hit the market, WLW isnât quite as unique as it once was. Lets keep in mind that both Markerâs Mark Cask Strength (at 113 proof) and Parkerâs Heritage Wheat Whiskey (a one-off release) are new products that donât have the years of refinement the WLW brand has. While both of the aforementioned whiskeys were fantastic this year, the 2014 edition of WLW is still the top dog. There isnât anything on the market that is as rich and bold as William Larue Weller. Other barrel proofers like Elijah Craig and George T. Stagg might be in the running, but nothing can match WLWâs sweet and robust flavors.","Even with a $10 increase this year, Buffalo Trace Antique Collection is a bargain in the premium bourbon field. Where Sazerac 18 Year is one of the pinnacles of rye whiskey, WLW is at the top of not only the wheated category, but also of all bourbon. There were a lot of bourbons increasing in price this year, especially in the premium category. Many of those limited releases cost upwards of $150 or more. Would I feel ripped off if I paid those prices for WLW? Not at all. This is one of the few bourbons that is worth a premium asking price.",Fall 2014,William Larue Weller 2014 Release
230, Blend of Straight Rye Whiskeys,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,90.4,Blend of 2 rye whiskeys, $50 (375ml) (2017),Sweeter than expected. Peaches and sweet summer fruits topped with honey are predominant. These are complemented by light rye spice and oak in the background. Itâs an unusual yet enjoyable combination that comes across more youthful than the blend would suggest.,"A slightly more viscous mouthfeel than standard Woodford products. Youth gives way to age as a dash of sweetness is found upfront followed by aged oak, rye bread, and dried raisins. Itâs not overly complex, but enjoyable enough.","he higher aged rye from the blend instantly pulls through in the finish as day old rye bread, tannic leather, and oak dominate. None of the earlier sweetness is present at all, and much like Woodford Reserve Distillerâs Select Rye, the finish lingers for several minutes.","Aged rye blends that mix a younger rye and an older rye are nothing new. For years, High West has done this with their Double Rye andRendezvous Rye. Blended Rye adds a unique twist by using ryes only made for a short amount of time. This is evident in the fact that both the ryes used, the 2004 Masterâs Collection and the (presumably tanked batch) of original rye from the inaugural batch of Distillerâs Select Rye are used. In addition, Woodford is the most transparent theyâve ever been with a release, listing out the exact mashbill, ages, and ratio of the ryes that compose this whiskey.Woodford Blended Rye is everything you wish Woodford Reserve Distillerâs Select Rye would be. I find the Distillerâs Select Rye to be severely lacking and a bottle that I havenât touched much since my original review of it. In fact, I came into this review fearing it would pull down the overall blend. Instead, it complements its older counterpart nicely. After having Blended Rye, itâs clear Woodford can turn out a good rye product. It would be great if Woodford would release a longer age stated 100% rye on its own to see how well it fares.","Blended Rye is priced a little over $10 more than Woodford Reserve Distillerâs Select Rye, but only being offered in a 375ml bottle, which makes it a whole $60 more when compared on a volume basis. While this might make it seem like a poor value, I surprisingly didnât walk away feeling this way. In fact, I felt it was a very fair price not only on the concept, but also based on the end result. Woodford really does a great job blending this rye and it shows, as it comes across as a big step ahead of their Distillerâs Select Rye. Yes a 750ml equivalent puts this in line with Woodford Masterâs Collection, but the thing of it is, Blended Rye is comprised of a high amount of extra aged Masterâs Collection rye from 2004. Additionally, the Woodford Reserve Distillerâs Select Rye that was used includes original barrels from the 2005 release. I often feel like Brown-Forman overcharges for their Woodford products, but this is a case where I certainly feel the price is justified.",Spring 2017,Woodford Reserve Blended Rye
231, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,90.4,NAS, $35 (2017),"Simple classic bourbon scents of vanilla, honey, and light oak intermingle with light hints of orange rind and graham cracker. These are all topped with a surprising amount of ethanol. While it isnât overly harsh, it seems odd for such a low proof bourbon. Ethanol aside, this is a low key nose with scents that are simple enough to enjoy for even a bourbon novice.","Slightly sweet and thin, the palate delivers light flavors of vanilla, honey, and citrus which rest over a thin layer of rye and oak. The ethanol that was noticeable in the nose is nowhere to be found in the palate. In fact this drinks very light and if I went into this blind, I would have guessed this to be an 80 proof bourbon based on intensity alone. The flavors arenât bad per say, but the palate is incredibly thin and leaves me wanting more.","Green pepper, aged oak, leather, and hints of tobacco are all noticeable up front. As the finish lingers, it gives way to a slow burn with dry leather and a slight hint of tobacco lingering for a while. It contrasts the nose and palate in that the sweetness takes a backseat, but not necessarily in a bad way. Itâs simple nature works well and the low proof makes this very easy to sip and enjoy.","When Woodford Reserve Distillerâs Select Bourbon first came out, it was at a time when charging $30 plus for an everyday bottle of bourbon was unusual. Those were the days before special releases like the Buffalo Trace Antique Collection or other high end yearly releases from the likes of Wild Turkey or Jim Beam flew off the shelves at much higher price points. Woodford Reserve tried to make bourbon cool again by bringing out a bold new bottle design and charging a premium price.Fast forward over 20 years, and what once was considered premium bourbon, now gets lost in the mix of hundreds of other bourbons on the market. That said, Woodford was actually able to maintain that perceived premium feeling with great marketing. From the unique bottle design that continues to stand out on bar shelves to this day, to its sponsoring the KY Derby, to its almost ubiquitous nature of being associated with bourbon-based manhattan cocktails, it manages to find ways to stay relevant.Woodford Reserve Distillerâs Select was the first bourbon that got me hooked on actually drinking bourbon straight and then neat when I was living in Kentucky years ago. While Iâve since long past moved on from reaching for a glass of it neat, I still think it makes for a nice subtle bourbon cocktail. A little of it is the marketing magic that Brown-Forman has engrained in me, but more importantly, its unobtrusive flavor profile allows the rest of the components of a cocktail to shine through and enhance the overall drink. This combined with the fact that I can find it in most bars, is what allows Woodford Reserve to continue to stay relevant in my book.","Here is a bourbon that for over 20 years hasnât gone up in price that much compared to many of its peers. Priced at $35 a bottle, it seems like this should be a great value for a bourbon in today's marketplace. That said, the market is much different from when Woodford Reserve Distillerâs Select was first introduced in 1996. The plethora of choices consumers now have means what once was considered premium is now considered a bit mundane. Sure you may get a unique looking bottle, but there are many bourbons in the $20-$40 range that deliver a better flavor profile for the money compared to Distillerâs Select. I would prefer to see this sold for $25-$30, as I feel that would be a fair asking price for what youâre getting.",Ongoing,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Bourbon
232, Straight Rye,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Disrtillery / Brown-Forman,90.4,NAS (Said to be 6-7 years old), $38,"Iâve always found the regular Woodford bourbon to have a low-key nose, and their new rye is no different. The nose is incredibly light, and I really have to inhale deeply to pull out anything substantial from it. Ever so subtle hints of rye, new wood, and strange as it may be, light rubber are present upfront. While lingering longer  on the nose produce hints of sweet pears and honey crisp apples. Itâs a shame how incredibly light this nose actually is seeing as the flavors work well together when you're able to actually pick them up. Additionally, slight traces of alcohol are present which is surprising since itâs only 90 proof.","While itâs definitely a rye, itâs a very subtle one at that. A peppery rye spice is present the moment you take a sip from the glass. Honey, fresh apples, and vanilla are also present. Seeing as Woodford chose to only use 53% rye in this bottle (legal definition of a rye is 51%), it doesnât surprise me that this flavor profile leans more towards a bourbon than the typical spiciness I associate with a more traditional rye. That being said, while the taste is very pleasing, when I go to pour a rye, I actually want to be able to distinguish it as a rye and not think how close the flavor profile is to a traditional bourbon.","The finish thankfully makes up for the lack of a nose and palate. It starts off as an upfront spicy mix of light pepper and leather with a dash of heat, which slowly morphs into a nice combination of pears lightly dipped in honey and vanilla. The finish is definitely the highlight. It lasts longer than I was expecting, and the delicious combination of flavors lingers and slowly fades away over a few minutes.","In a world full of ryes, Woodfordâs new entry into the market certainly isnât anything groundbreaking. What was surprising though, was how sweet the flavor profile is that Brown-Forman chose for this offering. Sure you find just a hint of a distinctive spice of a rye, however youâre greeted predominantly with sweet flavors that stand out above any traditional rye traits. Much like their bourbon, I felt they picked a middle of the road route trying to please more of the occasional rye drinker vs. someone looking for a rye with a lot of flavor. If youâre looking for a unique rye, youâll have to look elsewhere.","Taking into account that Brown-Forman markets Woodford as a premium brand, itâs no surprise that they gave the new Woodford Rye a premium price. At $38 a bottle, itâs not the most expensive rye on the market by any means, however when you take into account the whiskey in the bottle, itâs also not the best value. Personally, I would prefer to see this sold for $25-$30, as I feel that would be a fair asking price for what youâre getting.",Ongoing,Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Rye
233, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,90.4,NAS, $50 (375ml) (2017),"The additional time in a second barrel is quite noticeable. The heavy oak notes makes the nose comes across slightly stronger than its 90.4 proof. Hiding behind the oak are wafts of sweeter caramel, brown sugar, rye spice, and a dollop of syrup. The scents mingle nicely together and provide an enjoyable aroma.","Upon taking a sip, my mouth is coated as if I just took a shot of some sort of cooking oil. Its mouthfeel is viscous but oddly in a weird one-dimensional way. The dominant flavor is rich charred oak with the ever so slightest dab of vanilla, and without much support besides these two flavors. In fact Iâd be exaggerating if I said I was able to pull out any other noticeable flavors besides the oak. While itâs thankfully a nicely balanced oak flavor, the one-dimensionality of this palate is really a shame. The extra year in the wood seems to have muted all the best parts of the standard Double Oaked leaving only the oak behind.","The oak carries through to the finish and is joined with leather, caramel, brown sugar, and dried raisins up front. Eventually all the flavors drop off except for heavy dry charred oak and light brown sugar which lingers for a surprisingly long time. In the end the dry oaky taste overstays itâs welcome and reinforces the fact that this has spent a longer time in the barrel than need be.","Woodford Double Double Oaked is certainly unique, but not in a non-typical way. Itâs oaky flavor profile, while not defying any new boundaries, helps show the limitations of barrel finishing in a second new charred oak barrel. Where Double Oaked seems to be aged just the right amount of time, Double Double Oaked comes across as taking it too far. Its narrow flavor profile is a clear result of spending too much time in the second barrel. However without this extra year of aging, we wouldnât have had the chance to know what the limitations actually are of double oaked bourbons.","Priced at $5 more than Double Oaked, this would seem like a fair value. That is until you realize youâre getting half the product compared to Double Oaked, due to the fact that Double Double Oaked is only sold in 375ml bottles. This puts its 750ml equivalent pricing in line with Woodfordâs Masterâs Collection and over twice the cost of a standard bottle of Double Oaked. It certainly presents a unique experience, but the flavor profile does not elevate this bourbon anywhere near its asking price.",Ongoing,Woodford Reserve Double Double Oaked
234, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,90.4,NAS, $45 (2017),"Upon a deep inhale, Iâm greeted with a nice mixture of sweet and oaky. Toasted marshmallows, sweet vanilla, lightly toasted oak, and corn are topped with a drizzle of syrup. The additional aging in a second barrel seems to have imparted less wood on the nose than I would have expected, while also pulling forward the sweeter flavors youâd find in standard Woodford Reserve. Comparably, Double Oaked presents a surprisingly more diverse and enjoyable experience.","Oak and sweet vanilla are the dominant flavors here. Beneath are subtle hints of leather, caramel, and dried dark fruits. Seeing as this was exposed to new charred oak twice, itâs surprising to see how well the sweetness of the vanilla plays nicely with the woody oak flavors. Although it doesnât have a all-star flavor profile, Double Oaked still manages to come across as richer and heavier in comparison to standard Woodford Reserve. This is a very good thing seeing as how thin the standard expression comes across. Itâs still an easier sipper, however it doesnât taste nearly as watered down as its sibling does.","The mellowest of heat is present, which makes for a really nice clean enjoyable finish. Dry leather, oak, tobacco, burnt caramel, baking chocolate, rye spice, and sweet dried fruits are present at the start. The finish then morphs into leather, oak, and a dash of white pepper, which lingers for a surprisingly long time. The finish delivers a great flavorful experience that is straightforward and easy enough for bourbon drinkers of any experience level to enjoy.","Rebarreling whiskey to finish it in a second barrel isnât a new concept and wasnât new when Brown-Forman released Double Oaked. Barrel finished bourbons have been popular for a while and continue to gain popularity as the bourbon boom continues to expand. They make for an efficient way for distilleries to try to differentiate themselves in the crowded marketplace.What was unique about Double Oaked when hit the market was Brown-Forman using a new charred oak barrel as the second finishing barrel instead of a used one. Additionally, they let it sit in this barrel for several months. While others including Jim Beam have since released double oaked products, Brown-Forman was one of the first to experiment in this area with an on-the-shelf product. This simple, yet effective barrel finish imparts a large dose of much needed flavor to the just-average standard Woodford Reserve. Sure it doesnât transform it into a super memorable bourbon, but it makes enough of an impact to question why given the option, youâd reach for a pour of Distillerâs Select over Double Oaked.","At $10 more a bottle than Distiller's Select, Double Oaked is a fair deal. For a small upcharge consumers get a bourbon that delivers a more satisfying experience than its younger sibling. Additionally, Brown-Forman is spending extra money to use two brand new charred oak barrels for Double Oaked, versus using a less expensive used whiskey barrel for the finishing process. Taking that into account, you're not overpaying for what youâre receiving, however for what is delivered for Double Oakedâs price, there are still many bourbons that present a more unique or satisfying flavor profile.",Ongoing,Woodford Reserve Double Oaked
235, Straight Bourbon Finished in Brandy Barrels,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve / Brown-Forman Distillery,90.4,NAS, $100,"Lush fruits instantly jump out the moment I bring the glass to my nose. Warm spiced cherries mingle with berry filled cobbler topped with a hint of cranberry. Cinnamon bark, baking chocolate, and hints of light oak form the base. The nose is very warm and inviting and makes me wish standard Woodford smelled this way.","Itâs not as grain forward as standard Woodford Reserve, but instead has a quick burst of light berry sweetness that is followed by a drier oakier taste. It presents the usual thin mouthfeel I find in standard Woodford Reserve, however in this case, itâs an actual fault of this whiskey. Itâs too delicate and in a way it feels like the whiskey is purposely trying to not coat my mouth. I feel Iâm trying to wrestle this whiskey to even taste it, which is a bit of a shame since there are traces of good flavors here if only they could be pinned down easily.","While the nose and palate do a good job of helping highlight the brandy finishing on the whiskey, the finish reminds me more of a standard Woodford Reserve finish. Gone is the berry sweetness found in the nose and palate. Instead, a lingering buttery finish is present that provides a quick hit of green apple, hay, grass, and dried raisins before slowly mellowing out to light oak. It peters out into a drier astringent note, which almost ruins the whole experience. Thankfully whiskeys arenât determined after just one sip. After sitting with it for a while and getting acclimated to it, the astringent note becomes less and less overpowering and more a slight flaw rather than something that really takes away from the experience.","Barrel finished whiskey seems to be all the rage with many distillers using it as a way to help launch new and unique products in the market. That said, barrel finished whiskeys arenât anything new to the Woodford Master's Collection. Sometimes itâs worked well and sometimes it hasnât, as was the case with the 2014 Woodford Master's Collection: Sonoma-Cutrer Finish. What makes this release more unique is the fact that they chose brandy barrels, a finishing type that is still rare to finish whiskey in.Flavorwise, this year's Brandy Cask Finish delivered a pleasant surprise. The flavor profile is one solidly rooted in the Woodfordâs lineage, but enhanced to pull a more fruit forward flavor profile vs the more predominant grain found in standard Woodford Reserve. While Woodford Reserve is usually nothing to write home about, the brandy finishing ever so slightly enhances it into a more exciting product. It may not blow you away, but in a side by side comparison to standard Woodford Reserve, itâs definitely a more pleasant drinking experience.","Credit should be given to Brown-Forman for keeping the price consistent for the Masterâs Collection since its initial release. That said, a major downside to the Woodford Master's Collection has always been its price tag. Coming in at a $60+ premium over the standard Woodford MSRP, the Masterâs Collection has offered an inconsistent experience from year to year making it difficult to justify the price.While the whiskey in this yearâs collection is actually enjoyable, itâs not spectacular enough to justify the price tag unlike recent additions to the barrel finished category; High West A Midwinter Night's Dram, 1792 Port Finish, or Angel's Envy Rye. Take 1792 Port Finish for example. It was also aged for two additional years, except in port barrels, but still offered up a great tasting experience for only $40. Maybe brandy barrels cost more to acquire, but surely the price difference isnât enough to justify a $60 price differential.",November 2016,Woodford Reserve Master's Collection Brandy Cask Finish
236, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve / Brown-Forman Distillery,90.4,NAS, $100,"It packs big, bright, and robust bursts of cherry kool-aid, brown sugar, pine, and blackberry. Itâs a nice display of aromas that welcomes repeat nosing. Thereâs a little bit of dankness and wet wood aroma on the tail end of the nose, which while unfortunate, is far too minor to have a detrimental impact.","A dazzling fusion of graham cracker, malt, cherry, and brown sugar. There is some elegance to its complexity as the flavors mingle and open up. At times the malt notes can be quite assertive and help elevate this bourbon to great heights. Itâs an unique array of flavors that combine to make for a surprisingly enjoyable sipping bourbon.","A bit of heat ramps up during the finish and briefly mutes some of the palateâs flavors. As it resides, a nice amount of mild smoky notes become more noticeable overtop a malty and a dry oak base. Itâs a medium-long finish thatâs light on intensity and doesnât bring any new flavors to the sip, but overall hard to find any faults with.","Every year the Woodford Masterâs Collection surprises bourbon drinkers with its peculiar and at times frankenstein-like concoctions. For every successful release like 2007âs Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay Finish and 2012/2013âs Four Wood, there are disappointments like 2014âs Pinot Noir Finish and 2015âs 1838âs Style White Corn. While the series hasnât had the best track record, itâs hard to call it boring or unoriginal.With many American malt whiskeys being made more commonly by craft distilleries, itâs always noteworthy when a major Kentucky master distiller takes a stab at one. Morris already released a malt whiskey in the Masterâs Collection in 2013, but with this yearâs few modifications, he manages to add just the right amount of spin to make it a winner. Sometimes these type of experimental-type bourbons can come off tasting manufactured or the unique flavor element tasting like it was simply tacked on. At no point does this taste like a barrel finished bourbon or additive flavoring, rather an attempt at something completely new from the ground up. The flavors are intertwined which results in a decent amount of complexity and intricacy. Itâs an excellent sipping bourbon because it surprises without being offensive, and itâs complex enough without being boring.","With Woodfordâs lackluster track record of their Masterâs Collection, many bourbon drinkers remain hesitant opening up their wallets each year for this series. There also isnât the push that this is truly a limited, rare, or an overwhelmingly in-demand release that turns it into an impulse buy. Despite the general aversion from many in the bourbon community regarding this series, from speaking with store owners, Iâm often told they donât have any issues moving multiple cases of it. Where a few years ago charging $100 for experimental-type limited releases such as this, Parkerâs Heritage Collection, and Willett XCF was harder to swallow, itâs sadly becoming less so. Any purchase is a gamble and thatâs even more so with a series like this, but this year, $100 for Cherry Wood Smoked Barley is easier to swallow, in more ways than one.",November 2017,Woodford Reserve Master's Collection Cherry Wood Smoked Barley
237, Straight Bourbon,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Distillery  / Brown-Forman Distillery,125.8,NAS, $130 (2018),"A warm and rich aroma of toasted oak, pecan, vanilla, leather, and coconut with a slight touch of cherry soda pop. Itâs nicely layered as each scent has enough room to shine.","It tastes as dark as it looks, consisting of a rich medley of toasted nuts, tobacco, oak, and nutmeg. Itâs surprisingly light on sweeter notes that would have nicely balanced the heavy ones. The palateâs a bit one-sided that can taste bullish one minute and gentler in the next.","Consisting mostly of leather and oak, the flavors quickly drop off leaving behind a dry and slight tannic aftertaste. This is a shame as the palate brings a lot to the table and the finish simply doesnât follow through.","Iâve been waiting a long time to taste Woodford in its barrel proof form. Where many brands jumped on the barrel proof train long ago, Woodford, like Makerâs Mark a few years ago, remained stubbornly against the idea. Then Woodford seemingly out of nowhere released a high proof version of their flagship bourbon that clocks in at 125.8 proof. This is quite a jump from the etched-in-stone 90.4 proof they hit with every other release.In and of itself, there isnât much that is unique tasting about this bourbon. Woodford states that itâs a new way to tell the story of the five flavor sources â water, grain, fermentation, distillation, and maturation, but there is little that stands out in its taste that would allow you to pick it out from a lineup of other high proof bourbons. Remember, Woodford Reserveâs bourbon consists of a blend of pot still whiskey distilled at the company's distillery in Woodford County, and column still spirits from the Brown-Forman Distillery in Shively, Kentucky. What would have been far more interesting, is if the company released this in small numbers once a year and it solely contained bourbon from their Woodford Distillery. It would no longer be an apples to apples comparison to the standard Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Bourbon, but at least then the company could justify the higher price point and once a year release schedule. As much as this would muddy the waters of what defines a Woodford Reserve bourbon, at least it would be actually following with the Masterâs Collection branding of releasing unique whiskey.","Itâs hard to discern nowadays if there is a standard price for a barrel proof bourbon. Bookerâs Bourbon has been the long held flag bearer of the subgenre coming in for a long time at $55 then then increasing to $60-$70. Other popular brands like Stagg Jr. and Elijah Craig Barrel Proof have also staked a claim in the $60 range. Since then more and more limited releases, often barrel proof, have easily topped $100. Now, the only benchmark being barrel proof means you can expect to pay a premium (unless youâre Knob Creek Single Barrel or 1792 Full Proof, then all bets are off).If Woodford packaged up a barrel proof version of their bourbon a few years ago and priced it at $60 it would have easily been accepted. If they did a one-time Masterâs Collection release of it for $100, some people might have barked, but many would have come to terms with it. Instead, Woodford is asking for us to accept a $130 price tag for a barrel proof bourbon that they plan to release annually in unspecified batch sizes. Itâs also a 33% increase over the typical Masterâs Collection price of $100. Itâs a hard pill to swallow as it comes off as arrogant because they donât make a strong enough case for it. They say itâs being âdrawn from a select batch of barrels in a more raw, uncut form,â but is that enough? Wouldnât it have been nice if they claimed if it was being drawn from the best of the best barrels? If they went more out on a limb and declared it Woodfordâs best release yet? Sure that could open them up to bourbon hit squads, but at least it would be something. As is, the bourbon speaks for itself, and while this a fine bourbon, $130 for this particular release is simply asking too much.",April 2018,Woodford Reserve Master's Collection: Batch Proof 2018 Release
238, Whiskey,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Distillery  / Brown-Forman Distillery,90,NAS (Bourbon is roughly seven years old and spent another 10 months in wine barrels), $100,"It has a big cherry and fruity perfumed kick to it that overpowers any traditional bourbon scents. Itâs a rather odd mix of smells. Most shocking is that when itâs first poured from the bottle, the bourbon smells like its gone bad. Allowing some air to circulate in it helps open up some of the bourbon and oak aromas.","It has a very red fruit base to it. Cherry, currants and hints of strawberry and raspberry. Beneath the fruit are layers of oak, cedar and vanilla with touches of chocolate and earthiness. Very Pinot Noir tasting. While it has a medium body and nice mouthfeel, this bourbon is just overpowered by the wine that it was infused with from the barrel.","The finish leaves you with a funky aftertaste that lingers far too long. I actually squished my face when the the finish first hit. It tastes like some concoction you might have made in college when you were just learning to mix cocktails. Itâs a mashup of flavors that that are completely unbalanced. It truly tastes like someone poured Pinot Noir in your bourbon and said, âHere drink this.â The flavors donât mingle well and there is a very noticeable kick in Pinot Noir flavor near the end of the finish. This flavor really stays with you after the sip is gone, much like red wine does. That makes sense for wine, but with bourbon, itâs just odd.","Bourbon finished in wine barrels isnât anything new. Although it hasnât been done at high frequencies and in large quantities, this type of finishing has been explored before. Woodford even released one in 2007, which was finished in Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay barrels. 2014 saw an explosion of barrel finished bourbons with High Westâs A Midwinter Nightâs Dram having a similar wine barrel finish, but instead with port barrels. Where that bottle maintains a better balance between the bourbon and wine flavors, Woodfordâs Sonoma-Cutrer Pinot Noir Finish takes its wine finish too far. The best barrel finishes are the ones that gently mingle flavors together and provide a nice balance between the original bourbon flavor and the new barrel finish flavors. Weâve reviewed two High West barrel finishes, A Midwinter Nightâs Dram and Double Rye finished in Campfire Barrels, and both are great examples of proper finishing. Woodford might be onto something with their wine barrel finishes, but they seem like they need more time to test these before releasing them to the market.","As a stated one-off, much like Willettâs XCF, youâre paying for the privilege to taste something that will never be made [exactly the same] again. For some people its price point might seem fair to be given the opportunity to taste something brand new and very unique. If this was an everyday, on-the-shelf whiskey, Woodford could never charge $100 for it. It lacks proper refinement. Even the similar priced and superior A Midwinter Nights Dram is pushing the acceptable price boundary at $90. As is, Woodfordâs Sonoma-Cutrer Pinot Noir Finish is overpriced for whatâs in the bottle.",November 2014,Woodford Reserve Master's Collection: Sonoma-Cutrer Pinot Noir Finish
239, Straight Malt Whiskey,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,90.4,NAS, $35 (2018),"Sweet notes of malt grain and corn are predominant, which isnât surprising given the composition of the mashbill. Beneath these lie subtle hints of baking chocolate, baking spices, toffee, and brown sugar. Itâs simple yet really pleasing to the senses and easy to enjoy.","The palate is a mixture of sweet and hot with the latter taking on a dominant position. Malt grain, sweet cornbread, oak, and hint of baking chocolate all commingle with a dose of peppery heat. Itâs surprising to have so much heat in the palate given the relatively low proof and the fact that it wasnât present in the nose at all. Its presence is a disappointment as it brings down what could be a really enjoyable palate.","The heat from the palate quickly fades leaving rich flavors of cocoa, malt, nuts, and a hint of leather. What the finish lacks in complexity, it more than makes up for in length. Surprisingly, this finish seems to refuse to let go lasting minutes after the sip. Itâs a nice capstone for this whiskey.","Malt whiskey isnât a new groundbreaking category that Woodford is entering, with many American distillers having released malt whiskey products at this point. In fact, Woodford itself has released three malted whiskeys in the past including Masterâs Collection Straight Malt & Classic Malt Whiskey in 2013, a Distillery Series Five Malt in 2015, and a Distillery Series Malt aged in Double Oaked barrels in 2016. While all of those expressions were 100% malt mashbills, Woodford has gone a different route and shot for the bare minimum requirement here. And you know what, for the most part it works.Woodford Malt is distinct from Woodfordâs other expressions and refreshing in its approachability. This is a malt that can be easily appreciated by bourbon drinkers and is a nice foray into the malt category. I can only hope that this leads Woodford to create a wheated whiskey line extension next, so that they can play in all of the pre-prohibition approved four straight whiskey standards: bourbon, rye, wheat, and malt.","Coming in at $35, itâs nice to see that Woodford has priced this in line with their bourbon and rye. This provides a low barrier of entry to those bourbon and rye drinkers who are curious what an American malt whiskey tastes like. Additionally, itâs smart on Woodfordâs part as a large majority of their competition comes in around the $40-$50+ range. This gives the perception, real or otherwise, that this is a good value. Taking into account the flavors delivered, and its overall quality, this ends up translating into a good value for the consumer.",June 2018/Ongoing,Woodford Reserve Straight Malt Whiskey
240, Rye,Brown-Forman,Woodford Reserve Distillery / Brown-Forman Distillery,90.4,NAS,,"Initially sweet fragrances of vanilla, light rye spice, and a dab of caramel and toasted sugar are present. After lingering for a while and being exposed to a bit of air, the finishing, presumably from the Double Oaked barrels, begins to pull through adding aged oak to the fray that rounds out the experience. Itâs a subtle addition that plays well with the sweet fragrances in an overall subtle nose.","The sweetness carries through to the palate. Sweet cherries, butterscotch, and vanilla intertwine with doses of tannic wood. Not a trace of dominating rye spice in this palate, although this shouldnât come as a complete surprise though, as Distillerâs Select Rye also doesnât contain an overpowering rye profile. While the end result is certainly tasty, finishing in new and used bourbon barrels lessens whatever hope this rye had of tasting like a traditional rye, and instead moves the palate closer to tasting like a bourbon.","The finish is dry throughout. Butterscotch, leather, and aged wood are all immediately noticeable. It rounds out on notes of subtle rye spice, dry pepper, and leather, with a warming heat lingering slightly in the background. The delivery of these flavors however are mundane and this is the weakest link in the overall flavor profile.","From a pure maturation and finishing process, this is an interesting whiskey. It starts with maturing the rye in used Woodford Distillerâs Select Bourbon barrels for an undisclosed amount of time. The rye is then transferred over to new Double Oaked barrels for 2 years of finishing thus the naming for this release.I find standard Woodford Distillerâs Select Rye to be too subtle for a rye offering, lacking strong rye characteristics and leaning heavy on bourbon ones. I was hoping Toasted Oak Ryeâs maturation and finishing process would bring something new to the experience or at least offer a very unique flavor profile. While the use of used and new bourbon barrels adds oak and tannic flavors to the equation, it doesnât do much to really enhance it, or to really stand out among other barrel finished ryes in the market such as Angelâs Envy Rye or High West Double Rye releases that are finished in Campfire or Manhattanbarrels. With Toasted Oak Rye, you get a unique maturation and finishing backstory with an average end result.","I felt that Woodfordâs Blended Rye could easily own up to its $50 price tag, but I donât walk away feeling the same about Toasted Oak Rye. The flavor profile is just average, and while itâs interesting to have it finished in Double Oaked barrels for two years, overall it isnât advancing Woodfordâs Rye line. Add in the fact that this is only sold in 375ml bottles, and I have a hard time saying that this is money well spent.",Summer 2017,Woodford Reserve Toasted Oak Rye
241, Bourbon,Wyoming Whiskey,Wyoming Whiskey,88,NAS, $40 (2018),"Raisins, cherries, and cornbread mingle with one another. Floral notes also come into play, offsetting the sweeter elements. Nothing is overpowering, but the scents are potent enough to invite you in.","Peppy and bright. For the proof itâs full-flavored and mouth coating, but still has a perceivable lightness to it. Despite this, the flavors are rather pointed in their delivery. A heavy dose of sweet raisins is most evident, along with brown sugar and caramel. The sweeter side is nicely balanced against savory flavors of chewing tobacco and burnt wood, making for a layered and somewhat unique tasting sip.","Decently long, the finish lasts for quite some time. Sweeter notes give way to more savory ones, with tobacco and burnt wood being most prominent. The finish becomes dry towards the end, with a prominent astringency taking hold as it fades away. While the finish starts off really well, the transition towards astringency is impossible to ignore.","In some respects Wyoming Whiskeyâs technicals are quite unusual, while in others itâs some of the same - it really depends what youâre comparing it to and what your expectations are. While 53 gallon barrels are not unusual relative to the big distillers, whether in Kentucky or elsewhere, it is unusual for smaller production craft distilleries who tend to expedite the aging process by utilizing smaller barrels. Wyoming is also known to have fairly wild temperature swings between the seasons, but the same could be said for Kentucky and other states where bourbon is made. Further, the use of wheat as the secondary grain isnât unheard of, but itâs used much less so than rye. Taking the bourbonâs specific ingredients - their locally sourced grains, a mile-deep limestone aquifer where their water is sourced from, and use of two separate yeast strains builds on their differentiation. Finally, their distillation process yields 130 proof new make which is then reduced to 110 proof, barreled, and aged on site in one of their three rickhouses. Most distilleries can claim unique aspects of their process, but as the technicals start to pile up it seems Wyoming Whiskey starts to distinguish itself from the masses.So then it comes down to taste.The flavor profile is different, and unique in the sense that it doesnât remind me of much else Iâve had. Itâs quite sweet, but against that sweetness are more savory elements that I donât typically find together with the punchy sweetness. Despite its somewhat low proof, the flavors are still quite prominent though it could still be called an easy sipper.","Wyoming Whiskey distills, ages, and bottles their own whiskey. This isnât unusual in the craft whiskey world, but aging whiskey for five years in 53 gallon barrels is - enough to separate them from the majority of craft distillers. Story and disclosure aside, the end result is a bourbon that can stand up to others in its price range, including those bourbons produced by large Kentucky distilleries. It has a unique flavor profile, so it wonât be to everyoneâs liking, but what you get is a developed bourbon thatâs reasonably priced. Craft whiskeys are generally $50 or higher, but as production increases and distribution opens up we do sometimes see them come down to earth. Wyoming Whiskey has certainly reached that point, and as a result decided to price this at $40 - well within the range of affordability for many bourbon drinkers. Considering how well executed and unique the flavor profile is itâs an easy recommendation to give it a try.",Ongoing,Wyoming Whiskey Small Batch Bourbon

Weâ\\x80\\x99re told that future voyages will be the same mashbill as this one. The bourbon loaded onto ships for this voyage was around 6-7 years old before its sea voyage and was distilled in Kentucky, as compared with Ocean 2 out of Indiana. The bitterness and dry wood elements I noticed in Ocean 4 provide more substantial evidence of what a sea voyage might do to bourbon than the flavor characteristics I found in Ocean 3. Where Ocean 3 provided a more heavy-handed dose of sweetness and raisins, Ocean 4 shares the same underlying characteristics but delivers them in a more balanced and complex sip.',\n",

Iâ\\x80\\x99ll describe my own opinion as open, curious, and skeptical. But letâ\\x80\\x99s be clear about one thing, no matter what your take - this is an experiment and youâ\\x80\\x99re paying a premium to taste the results of this experiment. You can find equal, better, older, or more balanced bourbons for a lot less money.But alas, weâ\\x80\\x99re bourbon geeks and really like the experimental side of things, as evidenced by our\\xa0Bourbon Storage Experiment\\xa0and more experiments we have in the works. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve purchased and reviewed Ocean 2, 3, and now 4 because weâ\\x80\\x99re just that curious and a lot of readers have asked us to review this rendition. To that end, weâ\\x80\\x99d been growing increasingly frustrated with Jeffersonâ\\x80\\x99s lack of publicized details on these releases, so we reached out to them with a list of fairly pointed questions. We were happy that Trey Zoeller, Jefferson's founder and master blender, responded to us with some details we couldn't find anywhere else. The full Q&A with Trey can be found\\xa0here.We hope Jefferson's recognizes the community would prefer more information about what goes into making this Ocean bourbon and provides us with it. Knowing more about this actually increases this bourbon's value in my opinion.So all in, youâ\\x80\\x99re getting a 6-7 year-old Kentucky sourced bourbon, possibly with a similar mashbill and age as something else on the shelf for a fraction of the priceâ\\x80¦ however, youâ\\x80\\x99re also enjoying the opportunity to taste the results of this aged-at-sea experiment. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s cost to transport these barrels and load them onto ships. No other company is aging bourbon at sea. If youâ\\x80\\x99re ok with this then go for it, youâ\\x80\\x99re not going to find any other options that fit this bill. What youâ\\x80\\x99ll find in the bottle is good bourbon, just not any better than some bourbons you can find for a fraction of the price. But isnâ\\x80\\x99t that true of many of the higher priced options anyway?\\xa0[1]\"}"
